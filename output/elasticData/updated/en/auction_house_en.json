If it is impossible to publicly auction off all available movables, Moyersoen can resort to a comprehensive customer database in order to quickly realize an attractive result. For that particular purpose,<strong> Moyersoen</strong> regularly uses its storage capacities for clearance sales as quick and efficient results can be realized more easily for the different clients. Collaboration with trustees takes on an important role because of the comprehensive experience in the transaction of bankruptcies. As appraisers appointed by the court, the <strong>Moyersoen auction</strong> house appraises movable assets with regard to their continuation, acquisition or liquidation. In detailed consultation with its clients, Moyersoen develops the best liquidation strategies and consequently implements them so the creditors receive the maximum proceeds. The auction house also includes stocks, parts of enterprises, machines and business equipment into the professional liquidation service and regularly achieves excellent results. Another professional business segment at the&nbsp;<strong>Moyersoen auction house</strong>&nbsp;is the successful auction of vehicles.</p>\n<h2>Moyersoen Auction Portfolio</h2>\n<p>Moyersoen is involved in the liquidation of machines and industrial plants as well as business equipment and stocks of companies from all sectors.

Stefan Höchsmann, however, split up the company in 1998 and established the new company in trading second-hand machines for the wood working industry. Many years of experience in this field become apparent when viewing the broad range of services that reaches far beyond simply offering products. Potential buyers can choose whether they want to take over used machines, plants and tools in the actual state or whether they want to trust in the professional review and maintenance by the company's experts. The professional appraisal does not only serve the potential buyer but also the seller who can later refer to the market-conform results.<strong> Hoechsmann</strong> also ensures the professional dismantling, transport, extensive review and repair as well as the assembly and startup operations of machines and plants at the location of the client. Hochsmann's network of clients and customers tremendously grew over the years and allows the auction house now quick and profitable liquidations on behalf of its manifold clients that are recruited from among banks and bankruptcy trustees but also from companies.</p>\n<h2>Know-how and IT, a perfect synergy</h2>\n<p>A very special feature of Höchsmann GmbH for everyone interested in wood working is its <strong>encyclopedia WOOD TEC PEDIA</strong>, a comprehensive wood working lexicon, as well as its relevant directory of manufacturers. Both are accessible on the company's website. The online platform also presents the <strong>auctions via WOOD TED AUCTION</strong> and potential customers find all important information well categorized. On the one hand <strong>Höchsmann auctions</strong> are presented according to their date and on the other hand there is a catalog of all available machines. A search function helps in finding individual machine types and a filter for the individual items ready for liquidation can be found, too. The <strong>auction house Höchsmann</strong> is active beyond the German borders and the various language options on the website do not keep that a secret for long. A special highlight for all clients is the auction house's purchase offer, since it makes it possible to quickly and transparently offload entire machine parks.</p>\n<h5>Similar Auction Houses</h5>\n<div class=\"panel panel-default panel-body\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-3\"><a href=\"//trademachines.com/seller/surplex\">SURPLEX</a></div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-3\"><a href=\"//trademachines.com/seller/cnc-auction\">CNC-AUCTION / STIENS</a></div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-3\"><a href=\"//trademachines.com/seller/hilco\">HILCO INDUSTRIAL</a></div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-3\"><a href=\"//trademachines.com/seller/dechow\">DECHOW</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>"},{"id":"2922_en","content":"<p>The auction house <strong>Epic Auctions B.V.</strong> in Eindhoven was only founded in the end of 2013 and it enters the market with major dedication and commitment.
