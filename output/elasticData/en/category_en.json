Milling involves the use of rotary cutters to remove the excess material of a certain substrate (such as wood, metal or PVC). This process produces highly complex parts such as those seen in the automotive, aerospace and engineering industries. In modern times, a CNC universal milling machine is a common variant. CNC is an acronym for computer numerical control. Such technology has allowed milling to become highly automated while retaining superior levels of accuracy.</div> <h5>The Parts of a Universal Milling Machine</h5> <div>Besides the rotary blades themselves, there are several components which milling machines share in common. Most will contain a carousel that houses additional cutting tools. These can be interchanged depending upon the intended output. The universal milling machines have a swivel milling head which can be tilted to about 45 degrees from its standard position. CNC controls are in the form of a panel housed within the machine or a centralised computer. Tanks that supply coolant during the cutting process are another important component. <br /> <figure id=\"attachment_9827\" style=\"width: 200px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9827\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/universal-milling-machine-head.jpg\" alt=\"Milling head swiveled at an angle\" width=\"200\" height=\"103\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Milling Head Swivel</figcaption></figure> </div> <h2><i>The Top Manufacturers</i></h2> <div>When searching for a universal milling machine for sale, only the most reliable manufacturers should be chosen such as: <ul> <li>Meca Numeric</li> <li>EMCO Group</li> <li>600 Group</li> <li>ANG International</li> <li>CELLCON</li> <li>CHMER</li> <li>Isell Germany</li> <li>Ingersoll CM Systems</li> <li>Hiden Analytical</li> <li>HNK Machine Tool</li> </ul> <p>These are a handful of the top suppliers of such equipment.</p> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p>"},{"id":"7054_en","content":""},{"id":"7057_en","content":""},{"id":"7060_en","content":""},{"id":"7062_en","content":""},{"id":"7058_en","content":""},{"id":"7059_en","content":""},{"id":"7065_en","content":""},{"id":"7069_en","content":"<h2>Hydraulic Presses</h2> <p><figure id=\"attachment_10051\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10051\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/hydraulic-press.jpg\" alt=\"HOCHSTEIN PP 100 Hydraulic Press\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hydraulic presses can be used in a variety of industries</figcaption></figure></p> <p>A <strong>hydraulic press</strong> uses basic principles of physics to generate a compressive force.

The French mathematician Blaise Pascal formulated a physical law which stated that pressure on a fluid that is within a closed system is transmitted through that fluid without loss and acts with equal force on equal areas. This principle is applied in the workings of a hydraulic pressing machine which uses pistons acting as pumps. When such a piston is pushed inward it displaces the fluid which, being incompressible, acts on a larger piston. The distance moved by the large piston is equal to that moved by the small piston divided by the ratio of the areas of the piston heads.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_10053\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10053\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/hydraulic-press-machine.jpg\" alt=\"SMG HZPU-T 500-2250/1300 Hydraulic Press\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Find the best used hydraulic presses in online auctions</figcaption></figure></p> <p>There are <strong>many benefits</strong> in using a hydraulic power press. It can, unlike <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/mechanical-press\">mechanical presses</a></strong>, fully compress material and also takes up much less space. Hydraulic press working is used for a wide variety of industrial purposes as it can transform metallic objects into metal sheets. There are a number of different types of hydraulic press catering to various industrial requirements; a fact worth bearing in mind when looking for <strong>a hydraulic press for sale</strong>. Arbor presses are used for lighter work such as punching holes in or stamping metal. This makes this type a popular diy hydraulic press. A laminating press is a manual hydraulic press used for laminating polymer onto materials such as paper or metal. C frame presses are built in a C shape that helps them to take up a minimum of floor space and are generally used for straightening and drawing. Pneumatic presses compress air to create pressure. Although they cannot create extremely high pressures, they can be operated quickly. Power presses are used in heavy industry and are divided into part revolution and full revolution clutch types. <strong>Assembly presses</strong> use extreme pressure to assemble and maintain parts. H frame presses can handle more than one press application.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_10054\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10054\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/hydraulic-embossing-press.jpg\" alt=\"WOLFF HEP 400 Hydraulic Embossing Press\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">There are different hydraulic press types for different needs</figcaption></figure></p> <h2>Benefits Of Buying Hydraulic Presses For Sale At Auction</h2> <p>Hydraulic presses can be expensive items of equipment when purchased new.

Today, milling by way of <strong>CNC mills</strong> is one of the most widespread processes to be found in a wide array of industries and is used for machining parts to precise shapes and sizes. Milling is a process of cutting that uses a rotary cutting tool which often has multiple cutting points and is moved perpendicularly to its axis. As this milling cutter moves into the workpiece, the teeth of the tool shave off swarf with each pass by shear deformation action, performing numerous small, tiny cuts. The milling process falls into two major categories. Face milling is used in cutting flat surfaces or flat-bottomed cavities into material. Peripheral milling is used to cut deep slots and threads and is used in the production of gear teeth. In the case of vertical milling machines, the spindle axis is vertically oriented. With horizontal milling machines the cutter is mounted on a horizontal arbor. A <strong>3 axis CNC milling machine</strong>, utilising the X,Y and Z axes, is the most common, but the most advanced is a 5 axis CNC milling machine, also referred to as a multi axis machine, offering a degree of geometric complexity that can only be controlled by computers. Various configurations of CNC milling machines are available, including variants such as a box mill; a basic form of <strong>desktop CNC milling machine</strong> often used by hobbyists or in small workshops. Such a diy CNC mill can be obtained relatively inexpensively, especially in the used CNC milling machine market. A <strong>C frame mill</strong> is a larger mill used in industrial production. With a gantry mill, the milling head rides on parallel rails located at either side of the work surface.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11650\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11650\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/cnc-milling-machines-300x120.jpg\" alt=\"5 axis mill at work\" width=\"300\" height=\"120\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The 5 axles milling machine is the most advanced type of cnc mill</figcaption></figure> <h2>The Advantages Of Purchasing A Used CNC Milling At Auction</h2> <p>There are some distinct advantages to be enjoyed when you decide to purchase a <strong>used CNC mill for sale</strong>, the major one being cost.

There are several differences which therefore must be taken into account. First, <strong>a lubricant is necessary to keep the blade cool as well as to wash away potentially dangerous shavings and other debris.</strong> Secondly, metal cutting band saw blades will have more teeth and these can be constructed from such durable materials as titanium, corundum and even diamond.</p> <h3>Different Types Of Metal Band Saw</h3> <p><figure id=\"attachment_18468\" style=\"width: 124px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-18468\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Jet-metal-cutting-band-saw-110x300.jpg\" alt=\"jet metal bandsaw\" width=\"124\" height=\"338\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Metal cutting band saws are usually used for large plains of materials</figcaption></figure></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_18471\" style=\"width: 192px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-18471 \" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/harbor-freight-vertical-bandsaw-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"HARBOR FREIGHT vertical bandsaw\" width=\"192\" height=\"192\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">HARBOR FREIGHT vertical bandsaw</figcaption></figure></p> <p>It should be obvious that different tasks will require equally specialised <strong>metal cutting bandsaws</strong>. Its important when looking for used machines to find the right metal band saw for sale, to fit to your needs.  For example, a <strong>vertical metal bandsaw </strong>is generally used when large planes of material need to be cut (such as within industrial applications). <strong>horizontal metal band saw</strong> is used when not so big metal sheets needs  to be cut but the precision is very important to specific job. However, a <strong>small metal cutting band saw</strong> can be ideal for tasks around the home such as installing aluminium siding, cutting copper pipes and even working on die-cast models as a hobby. With using <strong>metal band saw blades</strong> the saw can cut more efficiently, especially with the smaller size bandsaws, gives more precise and reliable outcome. It is likewise possible that a <strong>portable metal cutting band saw</strong> could be used by a tradesman (or woman) such as an electrician or a plumber while on the job site.</p> <p>One of the most <strong>pronounced benefits</strong> is that metallic pieces can be made to exact measurements. This is an excellent amenity to be enjoyed during any do-it-yourself project. Furthermore, a used metal band saw machine boasts <strong>several safety mechanisms</strong> such as emergency stops, manual overrides and blade protectors when it is not in use. Such accessories are absolutely essential to prevent the possibility of a serious injury.</p> </p> <h2>Manufacturer Used Metal Bandsaws</h2> <p>It is always possible to encounter a new or <strong>used metal band saw</strong> with the help of top manufacturersץ One of the most famous metal bandsaw manufacturer is <strong>HARBOR FREIGHT</strong> 4x6 in <strong>vertical metal band saw</strong>.

A dust extraction system not only offers the convenience of a<strong> clean and clear workshop</strong>, but will also help to <strong>enhance the working conditions of machinery operators and workers</strong>.</p> <h2>Wood Dust Collection Systems</h2> <p>A <strong>dust collection system</strong> should collect all wood dust particles, typically at the source, and transport it from the <strong>woodworking dust collector</strong> to a saw dust collection system. While traditional models utilised a single stage collector connected to a 30 micron bag, the modern and safer alternative uses a two-stage collection system as well as bags or filtration system that trap considerably smaller dust particles. It is the smallest of particles that are known to cause the greatest potential damage to those in a close vicinity, and these are typically measured at 5 microns or smaller.</p> <h2>Single Stage Collectors</h2> <p>A single stage collector essentially works like a dust vacuum system. All particles, regardless of size, are passed into the filter and the existence of larger particles means that the filtration system can become clogged. At the very least, a <strong>single stage dust collector system</strong> will not prove as efficient at removing particles as a two-stage system.</p> <p></p> <h2>Cyclone Dust Collectors</h2> <p><strong>Cyclone</strong> <strong>dust collecting systems</strong> use a drum to separate particles. The turbine type effect enables larger dust particles to be separated before the smaller and more dangerous particles are passed through the second stage of the <strong>dust filtration system</strong>. Although cyclone models are more expensive, they are still available at relatively low cost, even for a portable dust collection system, and the extra money is worthwhile to protect you and other users. An<strong> industrial dust collector</strong> will have a lot of work to do in <strong>collecting and filtering particles</strong>. Anything less than a two-stage cyclone system will struggle with the load that it is placed under, and for heavy <strong>woodworking dust collection</strong>, this type of system should be considered an essential addition to the workshop.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_12740\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-12740 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/dust-collectors-300x250.jpg\" alt=\"dust collection systems\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dust collectors use a two stages cyclone system.</figcaption></figure> <p>Some maintenance is required with wood dust collection systems, in order to <strong>ensure that the filter remains clear, and the system can extract and collect the sawdust</strong>.

Lathe sizes are categorised by the maximum diameter of the workpiece they can turn. If you are interested in hobby turning, then the chances are that a <strong>small wood lathe</strong> will serve your purposes; perhaps a moderately sized light duty bench lathe. If you are tackling more extensive projects or require the tool for your business, then the woodworking lathe for sale selections you'll be browsing will be the bigger, base mounted and fixed machines. You might want your wood lathe machine to have an <strong>outboard turning facility</strong> to accommodate larger diameter workpieces.

The drill head is fitted with handles that are used to control the vertical movement of the spindle and chuck. The table of the bench drill press can also be <strong>moved vertically</strong>. This affords the bench drilling machine a number of advantages over hand held drills. The more powerful motor with which a bench top drill press is fitted allows larger drill bits to be used and also speeds up the process. Less physical effort is required from the operator of a <strong>bench drilling machine</strong>. A inbuilt clamp can be used to secure the workpiece, and as the spindle angle of a bench top press is fixed in relation to the table, holes can be drilled with greater accuracy and consistency. The best bench drill press models can be fitted with attachments to increase their versatility, including spindle sanders and mortisers.</p> <h2>Used Bench Drill Machine for Sale </h2> <p><figure id=\"attachment_24797\" style=\"width: 297px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-24797\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/bench-drill-machine-297x300.jpg\" alt=\"bench drill machine\" width=\"297\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bench drill can drill into various materials such as wood</figcaption></figure></p> <p>The size of a bench top press is defined in terms of its swing.

Asphalt paving systems are one of the essential machines in <a href=\"//trademachines.com/road-construction-machinery\"><strong>road construction machinery</strong></a>. In most conditions, a dump truck is used to carry the aggregate material. This asphalt is then fed into the hopper of the machine. A conveyor system transfers the asphalt to an auger. Finally, a mechanism known as a screed is used to evenly distribute the asphalt over the surface. This screed also provides an initial layer of compaction. Further uniformity is achieved through the use of an asphalt paver finisher. While this can be attached to the entire unit, it is not uncommon for a steam roller to follow the machine while the mixture is still wet. It may make numerous passes before the desired flatness is achieved. While <strong>asphalt paving machines</strong> tend to be quite large, they can normally be operated by only a handful of workers. These systems are almost fully automated and a great deal of surface area can be covered in an extremely short period of time.</p> <p></p> <h2>Used Asphalt Pavers For Sale</h2> <p>As can be imagined, these are extremely complex machines and therefore, quiet expansive. A good deal of foreknowledge in the machine specs and features is required before deciding upon a specific make and model. Some of the primary considerations will include the speed at which the paver is designed to travel. This will directly relate to the completion time of a project. Another critical factor is whether or not a free-floating screed is used. This is the better option, for the design will offer much more uniformity and as a result, less labour is involved during the final stages. It is finally necessary to point out that most of the  <strong>used asphalt pavers for sale</strong> are of good quality.

They can be operated singly or in parallel. Diesel generators are sized by their kVA standby rating within set optimum environmental conditions of 60% relative humidity, 154.2 metres above sea level and a site temperature of 27 degrees centigrade. This standard has been assumed by international convention, so when you see <a href=\"//trademachines.com/portable-generators\"><strong>portable generators for sale</strong></a>, you know that whatever their country of origin, they are held to a set rating. Diesel set sizes range from 8 to 30 kVA for small premises all the way up to 2,500 kVA for locations where the demand for power is far higher, such as factories. Before seeing what's available by way of portable diesel generators for sale, you need to check that the rating is correct for your requirements. Standard rating definitions have been formulated to <strong>allow you to make the correct choice</strong> and make valid comparisons between available machines and manufacturers. Fuel consumption costs should also be factored in before you make your choice of a used diesel generator. Obviously, the specific fuel consumption varies with each application, but as a rule of thumb a modern diesel plant will, at a loading of 65 to 70%, generate 3 kWh per litre of fuel. Their efficiency can be determine  by the amount of fuel consumption it the take in order to generate energy.  The fuel consumption of a Catepillar generator marks its efficiency as it is quite low, apart from the fact that they are very well built.</p> <p></p> <h2>The Benefits of Purchasing Used Diesel Generators</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_24209\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-24209\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/titan-7500-diesel-generator.jpg\" alt=\"titan 7500 diesel generator\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Used diesel generators can cost the fraction of the price of a new machine and give you the same results</figcaption></figure> <p>We are seeing an increasing demand for<strong> portable diesel generators for sale</strong>, as there is a definite lack of alternatives to standby generators for back-up and emergency power.

The standard class is known as semi-continuous, while a continuous asphalt mix plant is also known as an <strong>asphalt drum mix plant</strong>. Asphalt drum mix plants have the highest throughout of all of the classes and they are able to produce up to five hundred tonnes of material per hour.</p> <h2>The Advantages of a Mobile Asphalt Drum Mix Plant</h2> <p>This is ideal for freelance or independent contractors who have to travel to different sites to work. The<strong> mobile asphalt mixing plant</strong> will usually be significantly smaller than a regular plant to make it easily portable. However, it is still able to provide a decent level of throughput. This also means that the finished product does not need to be transported to the construction site after it has been created, as it can be created right on site. This eliminates the problem of cooling that sometimes occurs during transportation and helps to reduce costs.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8839\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8839\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/amp-3-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"Mobile asphalt mixer\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mobile asphalt mixing plant being transported to the construction site</figcaption></figure> <h2>Purchasing a Continuous Asphalt Mixing Plant</h2> <p>People who are looking for an <strong>asphalt plant for sale</strong> will find a lot of options to choose from.

In such instances, an <strong>electric floor saw is often the best choice</strong>. Some of the most common applications include cutting a section of floor to install hardware (such as plumbing or heating elements), trimming the edges off of newly installed tile and even removing an entire slab to gain access to a utility port (such as could be seen with a concrete floor saw used on a motorway).</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">The Parts of this Device</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">While the types of blades will differ depending upon the substrate required to be cut, the basic components of these machines are generally the same. <strong>The cutting surface is accompanied by an overhead protective device so that debris will not fly up and out while in use.</strong> The saw itself is mounted upon a rigid frame for excess control and some models will have frontal wheels to better adjust the height of the cutting tool. Two handles in the back will allow the floor saw machine to be pushed forward. They can also have a throttle to activate the rotation of the blade.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8983\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8983\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/fs-1-300x164.jpg\" alt=\"Laminate floor saw\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">cut laminate with a floor saw</figcaption></figure> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Types of Floor Saw Blades</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A floor saw cutting machine will <strong>normally be equipped to handle different blades</strong>. A laminate floor saw is partially defined by deeper teeth; ensuring a clean and accurate cut. The blade of a floor board saw appears much like the blade used with a traditional circular saw; the teeth can \"bite\" into the wood while producing less splinters. Concrete types do not have traditional teeth; grooves are instead cut into the circumference and a rough coating along the edges enables the saw to dig into the concrete, stone or tile.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Purchasing Floor Saws</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Whether one requires a laminate flooring saw or is instead seeking a concrete floor saw for sale, there are a number of sources to enjoy. A <strong>floor saw for sale</strong> is best found through one of the top manufacturers including HUSQVARNA, HONDA, MIKASA, LUZHEING Machinery, DEWALT, CONSMAC, POWERGEN, CAYKEN, STANLEY and VITIAN.

This means that the <strong>used combine harvester</strong> market is a vital and thriving one. For the best part of 6000 years, grain crops were harvested by hand in extremely labour intensive ways. Hiram Moore invented the first combine in the USA in 1834, but the first self-propelled machine did not appear until 1911. Since the 1980s, on-board electronics have been used to increase efficiency, and you'll find this asset available in many <strong>used combines</strong> for sale on the market. Today's combine harvesters derive their name from the way in which they combine three separate harvesting operations into one process; reaping, threshing and winnowing. They are equipped with <strong>removable heads</strong>, which are changed according to the crop being harvested. The machine cuts the cereal crops above ground level. These are then spun rapidly against a perforated metal grate so that the grain is propelled through the holes and thereby separated from the ear and straw. The grain is then passed through a<strong> series of sieves</strong> for further cleaning before entering a grain tank.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Used Combines Harversters for sale</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_24102\" style=\"width: 455px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-24102\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/MASSY-FERGUSON-combine.jpg\" alt=\"used MASSY FERGUSON combine\" width=\"455\" height=\"306\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">MASSY FERGUSON combine</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>As they are such a key item of agricultural equipment, <strong>combine harvesters for sale</strong> on the used market are highly sought after, and the used combine harvester market is a thriving one.

simply a <strong>tractor with tracks</strong>.

tractors are advantageous on a farm</figcaption></figure></p> <h2>Introduction to Front Loader Tractor</h2> <p>Tractor front loaders are devices which are broadly similar to the scoops of diggers, and can be attached to <strong>tractors</strong>. A tractor front end loader is useful in everyday <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\">agricultural machinery</a></strong> activities such as carrying and loading <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/bail-collectors\">hay baler</a></strong>. A tractor with front end loader is a useful piece of equipment on a farm where large objects are transported on a regular basis.</p> <h2>Varieties of Front Loader Tractor</h2> <p>It is possible to find large and small variety of<strong> </strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\"><strong>tractors for sale</strong>,</a> each having their own particular uses. When trying to find tractor front end loaders for sale, <strong>it is worth doing some research beforehand to find out which make will be suited to your own personal needs</strong>. Also make sure that the front loader is compatible with the tractor in question: there are specially-designed makes of <a href=\"//trademachines.com/compact-tractors\"><strong>compact tractor </strong></a>front end loader, for example. Tractors for sale are sometimes sold with front loaders included: if this interests you, it is a good idea to look for a complete front loader tractor for sale.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Tractor Front End Loader Manufacturers</h2> <p>Many companies such as <strong>Alo</strong> and<strong> Lynx Engineering</strong> manufacture tractor front end loader. It is worth mentioning that some design front loaders for use with the same company's tractors: for example, <strong>John Deere</strong> produces front loaders which are specifically made for John Deere tractors.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13420\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/John-Deere-650.jpg\" alt=\"John Deere 650\" width=\"1033\" height=\"684\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p>"},{"id":"7165_en","content":"<h2>Garden Tractors for Sale Used and New</h2> <p><figure id=\"attachment_13286\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-13286 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Simplicity-Sunstar-20-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"Simplicity garden tracktor\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Garden tractor with loader attachment</figcaption></figure></p> <p>Also known as a <strong>lawn tractor</strong>, a garden tractor is ideally suited for larger gardens or other <a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\"><strong>agricultural</strong></a> uses. They help save time and effort when cutting grass and maintaining a property. These tractors provide excellent performance in addition to power in order to maintain a lawn efficiently. They are also more comfortable for operators, reducing the strain of using a<strong> <a href=\"//trademachines.com/sit-on-mowers\">sit on mower</a></strong> to cut large grass in a large area.</p> <h2>Considerations When Buying a Garden Tractor</h2> <p>Always look at a selection of garden tractors for sale to find the right one for your needs. This type of equipment might be one of the most expensive pieces of equipment you buy to maintain your lawn. When looking at used<strong> garden tractors for sale</strong>, it is important to understand what choices are out there before investing in a new or used garden tractor. The first consideration is whether your lawn is large enough. A tractor might be a good idea of any lawn that is over 2,000 square metres or half an acre. Another consideration is whether a cutting deck is needed. Typically, wide deck sizes on a garden tractor will allow for quicker operation. If you have a smaller lawn, a tractor deck size of up to 42 inches or 116 centimetres should meet your needs. For larger lawns, consider buying a tractor with a cutting deck that is larger. <strong>Tractors</strong> also have a range of additional features, including aerators to move debris and hooks that allow you to tow cards with equipment and supplies. For low emission options that are gentler on the environment, overhead valve engines are also available.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_13287\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-13287 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/garden-tractor-pulling-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"garden tractors\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Garden tractor plowing</figcaption></figure></p> <h2>Manual versus Automatic Transmission</h2> <p>A new or<strong> used garden tractor</strong> for sale is available with manual and automatic transmission options. <strong>Automatic transmission</strong> garden tractors are easier to operated, allowing you to almost put the machine on cruise control to mow the lawn quickly and virtually effortlessly. For greater control, consider a manual transmission garden tractor. These are well suited for awkwardly shaped gardens or properties with different elevations. Manual transmission models with a clutch and gear shift also gives operators more control over the engine’s range of power. There are also <strong>Shift-On-The-Go transmission</strong> garden tractors where operators can change forward speeds without stopping, although a clutch is not used.</p> <h2>Major Garden Tractor Manufacturers</h2> <p>Some of the leading manufacturers of garden tractors for sale include <strong>Toro</strong>, <strong>Kubota</strong>, <strong>Countax</strong>, <strong>Honda</strong>, <strong>Westwood</strong>, <strong>MTD</strong>, and <strong>AL</strong>-<strong>CO</strong>. <strong>John</strong> <strong>Deere</strong> is a market leader in <a href=\"//trademachines.com/garden-and-urban-equipment\"><strong>garden machinery</strong></a>, including high performance garden and lawn tractors. <strong>Mountfield</strong> also produces quality ride-on tractors for lawns and gardens.</p> <h2>Operating a Garden Tractor Safely</h2> <p>When operating new or <strong>used garden tractors</strong>, you need to respect that these are powerful and precautions must be taken. Garden tractors should be driven slowly, especially when moving uphill. Always be cautious and aware of the surroundings, including clearing any large debris from the garden or yard beforehand. Operators should also wear protective gear such as ear plugs when using these machines for extended periods of time. New and used garden tractors for sale are also <strong>available with a range of safety features that are worth considering</strong>, especially when looking for <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\">tractor auctions</a>, </strong>including seat belts and automatically stopping blades when an operator stands up.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full

These were developed in the early 20th century and over time became synonymous with the vehicles that carried them. A <strong>major step forward came with the introduction of hydraulics</strong>, enabling the application of downward force, as well as better control of the blade. Today <strong>bull dozers</strong> are used extensively <strong>in the demolition and construction industries</strong>, but are also used in a wide variety of applications in which earthmoving capabilities are required, such as <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/road-construction-machinery\">road construction equipment</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/forestry-equipment\">logging equipment</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/mining\">mining</a></strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The main tools of <strong>bull dozer</strong> are the blade and the ripper. Bulldozer blades are generally available in three major types. The most common is the universal or U blade, which is curved so that more material can be held. The straight or S blade is shorter and can therefore be used for fine grading. A combination or SU blade has only a slight curvature and is particularly<strong> useful for pushing piles of coarse material.</strong> Blades can be fitted straight across the front of the vehicle or at an angle. Tilt cylinders may be used to vary the angle of the blade while in motion. Rippers are fitted to the back of the bulldozer and are used to break up the ground into rubble.</p>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26552\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26552\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/CASE-2050M-bulldozer-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"CASE 2050M bulldozer\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">CASE 2050M bulldozer</figcaption></figure>\r\n<h2>Caterpillar, Komatsu &amp; John Deere Bulldozers - And More</h2>\r\n<p>The durable and extremely reliable nature of the <a href=\"//trademachines.com/manufacturer/caterpillar\"><strong>CATERPILLAR</strong></a> brand make that company's products particularly sought after.

Compared to use of hands, it is faster and less tiresome. It is also quieter than a router. These advantages coupled with its ability to form perfect square and rectangular holes that pair well with tenons makes a mortise and tenon machine the preferred tool for many professional woodworkers.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">How Do Mortising  Machines Work?</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Mortising machine</strong> works effectively on a rock solid platform that effectively bears down on the cut. If a bench top model is used, a clamp or bolt is used to tightly hold the mortiser on the bench. This is because there is a tendency of the mortise machine to tip when the mortises start being hogged out. A cone-shaped stone is then used to sharpen the chisel's inside cutting edges and a flat stone to touch up the chisel's outside faces. To prevent a zigzag pattern from forming, the chisel is kept parallel to the fence. Zigzag patterns normally weaken the joints and are, therefore, completely undesirable. In addition, a file is used to sharpen the auger bit especially on the flutes of the bit and leading edges. For excellent work, the mortising machine should be a third of the thickness of the board while its depth should be between two thirds and a half of the board's width. Using stop blocks, the start and end holes are positioned and then a scrap piece is clamped on the work bench in order to support the long boards. After doing these, boring starts with the end of the mortise. Thereafter the interior of the mortise is removed leaving very little edges between the cuts. The work is then finished by removing the bridges.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Area of Operation</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Like many other woodworking machines, <strong>mortisers</strong> can be used in many areas. The most common of these is wood workshops. They are particularly popular with professional wood workers because of their efficiency and high quality work. However, amateurs about to start workshops also find them helpful. They can also be used by hobbyists of wood works.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Where to Get Mortisers?</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Getting <strong>mortisers machines</strong> for sale is not a tall order. Almost all wood machinery stores have them at great prices. Many a <strong>mortise machine for sale</strong> can actually be got at a discount from such stores. In addition, you can get good mortise machines for sale online on sites like amazon and ebay.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Mortiser Manufacturers</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">There are many manufacturers that produce mortise for sale. Whether it's a horizontal mortising machine, a slot mortising machine or any other mortising machine for sale or mortise and tenon machine for sale, there is no shortage of manufacturers of quality <strong>mortising machines for sale</strong>. Some of these manufacturers include BW, RK, CBS, Central CWC, KWO and CHARNWOOD.</p>"},{"id":"7003_en","content":"<p>In metal working accuracy is everything, but that accuracy can't be achieved without a proper starting point.

The process of cutting materials can be automated using a CNC water jet, and 5 axis water jet cutting machines can produce more intricate 3-D shapes using motion control technology.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>What is the structure of a Water Jet Cutting Machine?</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">High pressure water is fed into the water jet machine through an inlet. Then the water reaches a jewelled opening made of either diamond or ruby. Water passes through this opening and, in the case of abrasive water jet cutting machine tools, an abrasive mixture (made materials such as garnet) is introduced in the mixing tube to aid in the cutting of harder materials. The water then passes out the nozzle at high pressure and onto the cutting surface below.  <br /> A portable water jet cutting machine will also have all these components, including a supply of high pressure water, but on a trolley or some other wheeling device. The Water Jet can be connected to a computer device that can relay instructions to the machine, allowing the process to be automated. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>What are the different types of Water Jet Cutting Machines?</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">There are two main types of water cutting machine devices that are ideal for penetrating certain strengths of material. The pure water jet machine uses untreated water to cut soft materials such as wood, and it is the water pressure that does the cutting.  <br /> In contrast, the abrasive water jet cutting machine shoots out high pressure water that has been treated with an abrasive. The force of the abrasive hitting the material is what cuts the material, as opposed to the water.  <br /> Both types can be bought as a portable water jet cutter and are available in a range of sizes. For automated cutting, there are CNC water jet cutting machine solutions on the market, as well as advanced 5 axis machines for perpendicular and rotation cutting. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Which Industries Use Waterjet Cutting Machines?</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Because waterjet cutting machine solutions can cut, ream and shape materials without having to consider the distorting effects of temperature, this tool can be used in many industries, including aerospace and mining. The ability to automate a process with a CNC water jet cutter also makes the water jet an attractive solution in manufacturing, providing accurate and repeatable cuts.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Who Makes Water Jet Cutting Machines?</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In the US, there are many manufacturers that produce water jet cutting machines.

The process was later applied to welding steel but it wasn't until the late 50s and early 60s that it became commonly used<strong> <a href=\"//trademachines.com/welding-machines\">welding machine</a></strong> in a wide range of industries. Today MIG welding is the most widely employed industrial welding process due to its rapidity, versatility and relative ease of use. It can also be adapted to robotic automation and is used in automotive, <strong>sheet metal tools, in addition to <a href=\"//trademachines.com/sheet-metal-working\">sheet metal machinery</a></strong> and numerous other applications. This widespread popularity means that <strong>used MIG welders for sale</strong> are soon snapped up. The essential equipment for carrying out MIG welding is a welding gun, power supply, MIG welding wire and a MIG welding gas for shielding the workpiece from contamination. When the operator presses the control switch the electric power, wire feed and flow of shielding gas are activated. An electric arc is formed between the wire electrode and the metal that is being worked on. Keeping a consistent distance between the tip of the electrode and the metal being welded, the operator steadily guides the welding gun at a travel angle along the length of the weld area. With a <strong>gas MIG welder</strong> the weld area is protected from airborne contaminants by the steady and constant application of gases such as carbon dioxide, helium or argon, or combinations thereof. Additionally, inverter MIG welders now offer high grade, multi process welding capabilities so that one machine can handle a number of welding processes.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_10129\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10129\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/MIG-welder-power.jpg\" alt=\"DECA MIG Welding Power Control\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Control System of MIG Welding</figcaption></figure></p> <h2>Advantages to be Gained by Purchasing a Used MIG Welder at Auction</h2> <p>If you are looking for a <strong>MIG welder for sale</strong>, then you'll be pleased to know that cheap MIG welders are commonly available via <strong>used welding equipmen<a href=\"//trademachines.com/welding-machines\">t</a></strong> auction sites.

Electric welders can be divided into two specific types,<strong> consumable electrode and non-consumable electrode</strong>. The former category includes shielded metal arc welding, otherwise known as stick welding and manual metal arc welding, in which an electric current creates an arc between the material being worked on and the electrode, which is consumed to form the filler material. This process is mostly limited to ferrous materials. Other consumable electrode methods are gas metal arc welding, often called MIG; flux cored arc welding and submerged arc welding. Another category of electric welding equipment involves non-consumable electrodes. Gas tungsten arc welding, commonly known as TIG welding, utilises an electrode made of tungsten and is mostly used in welding thin materials. TIG welding can be used on nearly all metals capable of being welded, but requires a higher level of operator skill than MIG welding. When looking for an <strong>electric welding machine for sale</strong>, the kind you buy should be the one best suited for the specific functions you will be requiring of it. Specific aspects you will need to consider when choosing electric welders for sale is the amperage requirement and the duty cycle.

Additionally, they can be used to cut dovetail joints. As the name implies, they have traditionally been used in the creation of <strong>scrollworks</strong>. In function, a scroll saw is similar to a band saw, but whereas a band saw is fitted with a blade on a continuous loop, a scroll saw uses blades resembling those of coping saws and functions by way of a reciprocating motion. With scroll saws it is not necessary to create an entry aperture for the blade at the edge of the item being worked on as the machine's blade can be removed and placed through a pre-drilled starting hole to make completely enclosed internal cuts. Such advantages allow for a considerable amount of leeway for creativity, giving rise to the popularity of this tool amongst woodworkers. When looking for <strong>a scroll saw for sale</strong> it's worth noting that there are a number of different types. The rigid arm scroll saw is no longer produced, but can still be found from time to time in a scroll saw sale. Today's most common design has the motor attached near the back of the arms, which always remain parallel in relation to each other, leading to the machine being referred to as a parallel arm saw. The C arm saw has the motor mounted between the two ends of a C shaped arm. The parallel link saw has movable articulated arms holding the blade. Scroll saws are categorized according to the size of the distance between the blade and the rear frame. This is called the throat, and determines how large the scroll saw wood workpiece can be. Scroll saw blades are generally around 12.7 cm in length and are divided into a number of major types; skip tooth, double skip tooth, crown (2 way), spiral, reverse tooth, ultra-reverse, metal cutting and diamond.</p> <h2>Looking For A Used Scroll Saw For Sale At Auction</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_11590\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11590 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/scrall-saws-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"Scroll saw cutting\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scroll saw cutting precise forms out of wood</figcaption></figure> <p>There are three major considerations to take into account when choosing a scroll saw for sale.

Compact circular saw  is durable, the saw is laid down on the wood, and saves hours of unnecessary 'back and forth' hard work for the user. What could take hours of hard graft can be completed in hours, or even minutes, by just a <strong>small circular saw</strong>. Of course, for the more serious contractor or specialist carpenter, a <strong>table</strong> <strong>circular saw </strong>is going to be far more suitable for the majority of projects. In essence, this is a larger, more 'grounded' version of the regular compact circular saw and is generally <strong>a static fixture in the carpenter's workshop</strong>. This is, as a rule, a very expensive piece of equipment and as such is most likely going to be a waste of time for all but those in the trade. With these two pieces of equipment and their purposes clarified, its easy to see why someone may want to shell out the extra cash for one of these, and extra items to make its use easier still, such as a <strong>table circular saw</strong>, or other custom furniture. This extra outlay will, over its life, save hundreds of staff hours for the professional or countless headaches for the everyday DIY enthusiast... Not to mention ensuring the <strong>wood is cut straight</strong> above all else!</p> <figure id=\"attachment_18542\" style=\"width: 189px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-18542\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Makita-14-inch-woodworking-Circular-Saw-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Makita 14 inch woodworking circular saw\" width=\"189\" height=\"189\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">MAKITA 14 inch woodworking circular saw</figcaption></figure> <h2>Choose the best used Circular Saw for Sale </h2> <p>If you need to ask this question, then the fact is that a smaller piece of machinery is probably more suitable for your needs. <strong>Professionals will own this machinery as standard</strong>, and for the more casual user, it may be worth even waiting until you see a cheap used wood circular saw for sale rather than parting with a large amount of money for a new one. There is no hard and fast rule to a used <strong>circular saw sale</strong>; it really is a case of looking  into the <strong>second hand market</strong>, seeing the range of available used kits and picking the best one for your needs. At a non professional level, the builds are very similar, unlike the prices, which soon jump when added features come into play. Of course, if a lucky find digs up a professional used <strong>circular saw for sale</strong> at a knockdown price, there is no contest. But do not get too wrapped up in finding one that absolutely must look the part. A budget brand will still cut wood in a perfectly straight line, and this is the crux of any need for a used table circular saw for sale<strong>.</strong></p> <p></p> <p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18537\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/woodworking-circular-saw-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"woodworking circular saw\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></p> <h3>Popular Projects For Circular Saw</h3> <p><strong>Best circular saws are generally used where a normal saw just can't 'cut the mustard'</strong>. As such, a standard plank of wood is probably not going to require the use of even a compact circular saw. Some of the projects that are going to be more likely to need 'mechanical intervention', especially through this kind of <a href=\"//trademachines.com/wood-saws\"><strong>woodworking saws</strong></a>, include, but are by no means limited to:</p> <ul> <li>Garden shed/summerhouse construction</li> <li>Support and roofing beams</li> <li>Large wooden furniture projects</li> <li>Wendy/play houses</li> <li>Boat and marine vehicle restoration</li> </ul> <p>Not your average set of timber based jobs, but by the same token not just projects reserved for the professionals.</p> <h2>Safety Additions to the Circular Saw</h2> <p>From a safety perspective, personal protective equipment is a must. <strong>Eye protection and gloves should be a staple accompanying purchase.</strong> Replacement blades are also high on the list. As time passes, blades (much like any tool) will become blunt, bent and buckled, resulting in jagged lines, burnt wood from overworked blades, and potential danger from weakened blades firing shards. Any hardware shop will have a member of staff that can not only show you what other items you should be buying to go with your saw, but on a good day, they may even be able to fire up a demonstration model, which not only shows you what each model can do, but also tells you whether you can handle the power of such machinery.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13207 size-full\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/dewalt-dws780.jpg\" alt=\"dewalt dws780\" width=\"1316\" height=\"903\" /></p>"},{"id":"7108_en","content":"<h3>Vacuum Pressing Process Working</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_26594\" style=\"width: 555px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-26594\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/ORMA-MACCHINE-vacuum-plus-mambrane-press.jpg\" alt=\"ORMA MACCHINE vacuum plus mambrane press\" width=\"555\" height=\"416\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ORMA MACCHINE vacuum plus mambrane press</figcaption></figure> <p>The intention of a <strong>vacuum heat press</strong> is to shape a piece of plastic or similar polymer into an exact form with the help of a single-surface mould and a vacuum. This is actually a variant of a process known as thermoforming. Once the sheet of plastic is put into place, the <strong>vacuum membrane press machine</strong> will begin with a thin sheet of a thermoplastic (such as polystyrene). After it is heated, it is forced against a specific form. A vacuum will then remove any existing air trapped within a cavity; forcing the thermoplastic to conform to an intended shape. Once the plastic cools, it is removed.</p> <h3>Applications of Vacuum Pressing Systems</h3> <p>There are numerous industries which employ the use of a vacuum press table. Some common items that can be made include automated teller (ATM) machines, medical diagnostic equipment, engine covers and even dashboards. However, another interesting application can be seen in a <strong>woodworking vacuum press</strong>. In this instance, a vacuum is applied to the surface of the wood. As more than 1,000 kilograms of pressure per square foot is often possible (depending upon the model), this is an excellent way to force veneer into the porous surface of the wood. In fact, the liquid will penetrate much deeper and more uniformly than with traditional methods. Although this is not as common as the previously mentioned thermoplastic processes, it is still a valuable tool to possess.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_26595\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26595\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Vacuum-membrane-press-at-work-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"Vacuum membrane press at work\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vacuum membrane press at work</figcaption></figure> <h2>Used Vacuum Press for Sale</h2> <p>Perhaps the most important variable which needs to be taken into account is the <strong>amount of pressure that the vacuum will exert</strong>.

Examples can include Ultraflex Power, Vuototecnica, Qualityvak, Bagpress, MAAC Machinery, Ridat, Belovac, GN Thermoforming Equipment and Liven Impex. <strong>Vacuum presses</strong> are important industrial machines. Taking all variables into account will enable the best choices to be made. If you are looking for a vacuum press for your woodworking plant, a new machine might me an expansive adventure. Buying a used vacuum press might be an excellent solution for those who cant spend large amount and still buy a rhliable machine.

Simply put, the oil is fed into the ram, which causes the ram to push forward against different parts of the crane truck. The rams act to move the arm of the crane. Some truck cranes may also have what is known of as a \"boom\", which allows the final section of the arm (if there are multiple sections) to extend forward, greatly increasing the reach of the truck crane, though a longer reach requires a more stable base (a bigger truck, for example). In truck mounted cranes, the hydraulics are typically powered by a pump attached to the engine of the truck itself, meaning the truck has to be running in order to use the crane. The crane itself is usually<strong> controlled by a series of levers</strong> by the base of the crane, and will sometimes have a second set of controls on a remote unit, either on a long cable or wireless.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_12771\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-12771 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/truck-crane1-300x173.jpg\" alt=\"truck mounted crane\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The truck cranes hydraulics are powered by engine pumps</figcaption></figure> <h2>Used Crane Trucks</h2> <p>Truck mounted cranes, whether attached to a small pickup truck or an eighteen wheeler big rig, have been crucial in just about any situation where heavy objects need to be moved.

These cranes are typically used to lift heavy objects so there is a lot of potential danger in seemingly mundane things, such as moving the crane too quickly and causing the lifted item to swing, unbalancing the truck or hitting surrounding objects. Multiple tons of swinging plant machinery is nobody's idea of a good time. Truck cranes come with stabilising feet that extend out from the sides of the truck, <strong>offering greatly increased stability</strong>. Use of these feet is essential, and many systems will be built in such a way that the crane will not operate if the stabilising feet are not extended. It's not hard to find pictures of trucks on their side because they've attempted to lift something and ended up tipping the truck itself!</p> <h3>Crane Trucks Manufacturers  </h3> <p>While looking for a used crane trucks for sale, one must know which manufacturers are specialized in manufacturing truck cranes. One of the <strong>many well known manufacturers</strong> is HIAB (Hydrauliska Industri AB).

For instance, a hydraulic concrete saw uses pressurised liquids to power the cutting of hard materials, while a gas powered concrete saw may use a petrol combustion engine. The blade on a concrete saw cutter is commonly lined with diamond because of its robustness and durability. However, for cutting the toughest materials the diamond can still wear which is why there are concrete wet saw options available. Keeping the blade wet will also keep dust at a minimum and prolong the life of the blade.

You'll find that each chain saw for sale listed below will suit certain conditions and will have inherent dangers when in use.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">• The <strong>concrete hole saw</strong> is a concrete hand saw used for cutting holes in walls, whether for piping or venting. Used often in the construction industry, its concrete saw blade sets it apart from regular hole cutters.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">• Another construction tool is the <strong>electric concrete saw</strong>. The lightweight, quieter features of this type of saw makes it ideal for enclosed environments such as working inside a home.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">• A <strong>concrete chainsaw</strong> is a handheld hydraulic concrete saw or pneumatic concrete saw solution that is primarily used to cut brick walls and piping, and can operate as a concrete floor saw also.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">• <strong>Concrete wet saw</strong> solutions are used for high powered jobs such as cutting deep into concrete surfaces and long stretches of asphalt, often using an electric walk behind concrete saw.

Concrete mixer truck can also come in the form of a concrete mixer trailer, which can be towed by a regular vehicle or truck. This allows for the mixing of cement in larger quantities than smaller, portable mixing tools, and without the need to build semi permanent infrastructure to handle the cement mixing during the construction process.</p> <h2>Used Mixer Trucks for Sale</h2> <p>Due to the nature the business, a lot of used mixer trucks appear on the second hand market simply because they are former rental units, or were purchased for a large job that has been completed. In short, a <strong>used concrete mixer truck</strong> will often be in perfectly good condition, so don't be put off by the volume of used concrete trucks for sale; it doesn't mean they're broken down hulks. Used concrete mixer trucks for sale on the Internet can<strong> save you a fortune</strong> over their newer cousins. In fact, concrete mixer trucks for sale represent even more savings for short term use, as they can be sold on afterwards. And don't forget, it's not just mixer trucks for sale; it's not hard to find a good concrete u<strong>sed mixer trailer for sale</strong> online, either. The Internet can provide for your mixing needs with anything from small to large scale construction, whether you're a small operation in need of a single cement mixer truck for sale, or a large operation looking to add to or build a fleet of trucks, you needn't pay through the nose.</p> <p></p> <h2>Cement Mixer Truck Manufacturers</h2> <p>Finding a decent <strong>cement mixer truck</strong> by brand can be a little tricky, as there are actually two manufacturers to look at; the manufacturer of the mixer itself, and the manufacturer of the truck on which it is fitted. Truck manufacturers are a whole other page by themselves, so here are a few mixer manufacturers; Liebherr, Hymix, McNeilus, Sany, McPheeBros, Schumaker Industries, London Machinery, MAN, Mercedes-Benz,Schwing.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13451\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/cement-mixer-truck.jpg\" alt=\"cement mixer truck\" width=\"948\" height=\"552\" /></p>"},{"id":"7148_en","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Plaster spraying machines</strong> are used to apply plaster as well as other different types of decorative wall coatings in the construction industry. The benefits of using a plaster sprayer, instead of the traditional method of applying plaster by hand, are that a far greater meterage can be covered in a shorter time period which is obviously economically beneficial and also less labour intensive.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11104\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11104\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/plaster-sprayer-300x164.jpg\" alt=\"Plaster sprayer in use\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plaster sprayer spreading plaster on the wall</figcaption></figure> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Types of Plaster Sprayers</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Air fed hopper spray guns use a gravity fed hopper, positioned on top of the pistol, to introduce the material and can be used to apply thinner coats of plaster and other types of decorative wall coatings. These <strong>plaster sprayers</strong> are ideal for applying a finishing coat of around 1mm to plaster boards and pre-prepared walls. Screw spray pumps are a compact machine capable of applying thicker coats of plaster and are therefore ideal for levelling up. They can also spray a range of other materials; spray mortars and cement based coatings, finish plasters and waterproofing render, heavy bodied coatings and fireproofing. These plaster sprayers use the mono pump principle with a worm drive to spray the material. Being a heavy machine with a large hopper, electric motor and pump drive they are usually on wheels to improve portability. Larger versions of this machine, working on the same principle, are used to spray concrete, a process called Gunite which is used for the construction of swimming pools and other reinforced structures.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Manufacturers of Plaster Sprayers</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Various companies manufacture <strong>plaster sprayers</strong>. Refina offer a wide range of plaster spraying machines; from the smaller hopper spray guns through to large industrial pump driven machines, capable of spraying heavy bodied wall coatings. Wagner are one of the most popular manufacturers of plaster sprayers amongst professionals and they have an extensive range of machines available. Other manufacturers of plaster sprayers include: Utiform, Strata, Maltech, PFT, EMP, M-tec, Deutsche Fördertechnik, Graco, ASM and EZE to name but a few.</p> <p></p>"},{"id":"7145_en","content":"<h2>Concrete Silos in Construction</h2> <p>A <strong>concrete silo,</strong> or <strong>cement silo</strong>, offers storage and measurement of concrete powder.

As well as being useful in daily manoeuvring operations, a telescopic crane gives access to areas other machines cannot move through.</p> <h2>A telescopic boom crane makes everyday tasks more efficient</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_7873\" style=\"width: 275px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7873\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/tc-1-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"boom telescopic cran\" width=\"275\" height=\"152\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Telescopic cranes can move items to difficult accessable sites</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Telescopic cranes</strong> are able to move items on sites that are difficult to access. It is possible to adjust and extend the boom portion of the machine to make adjustments, allowing the operator to remove problems relating to height. With the boom extended, it is possible to move items from one area to another. Using extensions, like forks, it is possible to move industry-specific loads. For example, a fork allows those in the agriculture sector to haul bales of hay and grabs are ideal for moving dirt. A telescoping crane brings<strong> extra safety</strong> to environments where large items need to be moved around people. Those featuring hydraulic systems are ideal for loading and disembarking cargo in a port smoothly, allowing staff on the ground to move around as usual.</p> <h2>Moving through awkward environments with mobile telescopic cranes</h2> <p>A telescoping boom crane features a jib that allows the operator to adjust the load at a range of angles. For example, the Liebherr cranes can reach angles of 40 degrees, which removes the need to move the machinery over awkward terrains, or between tight spaces. Experienced operators can <strong>make the most</strong> of the on-board control panels, which often feature safety indicators that state when the machinery is in operation or idling. This is particularly useful for those working around the crane on foot, as external warning systems deliver warnings regarding the telescopic mobile crane and its movements.</p> <h2>Choosing the right telescopic crane for sale</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_7872\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7872 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/tc-3-300x184.jpg\" alt=\"Telescoping crawler cran\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Telescopic cranes have important safety features</figcaption></figure> <p>Most telescopic cranes come with the same basic features. This includes failsafe brakes, maintenance-free jibs and cylinders, a self-contained unit and ways to attach them to other machines via easy welding. When choosing a <strong>hydraulic telescopic crane</strong>, it is necessary to look for other defining features. For example, steel casing that prevents rusting, ones with starters for electric motors, and lights on the jib for nighttime operations. Buyers may also want to try a crawler telescopic crane, as they are ready to use as soon as they arrive on the site.</p> <h2>Working with telescopic cranes</h2> <p>It is essential that those who operate these cranes are fully trained. Use by unskilled workers, especially in environments where other workers are not aware of how the cranes function, can lead to accidents.

lawn mowers are compact and safe for home uses</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Once upon a time, grass was kept cropped short by livestock nibbling it down, or else left to grow wild. These days <a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\"><strong>agriculture</strong> </a>advanced, as in many areas of life, we have machines to do our hard work for us. What most <strong>lawnmowers</strong> have in common is a motorised blade, which rotates to cut the grass as the <strong>lawn mower</strong> is pushed over it. In the years since the Second World War, the sizes of our gardens has grown as our leisure time has (generally) increased, and so <strong>small motors used to power lawn mowers have needed to become more powerful</strong>. Modern lawn mowers have an horizontal blade, which spins fast enough that it cuts and mowing grass with the blades as they hit the grass. The case around the blade is called the deck, and the deck is typically square in shape. The deck has a dual function: it covers the blade as it spins for safety reasons, and it acts as a guard for the cut grass, preventing it from flying out everywhere. In <strong>best lawn mower</strong> models, the deck sits on top of four wheels, with the motor on top and a box or bag to gather up the cut grass. The most basic form of the modern <strong>lawnmower</strong> requires the person cutting the grass to stand behind it and push in order for it to operate. However, for large gardens, golf courses, football pitches, cricket fields and the like, self-propelled or <strong>riding lawn mowers</strong> are usually more appropriate (and labour saving). Some really advanced models include hovercraft versions, which don't need to be pushed and ride instead on a cushion of air. <strong>Then there are robot lawn mowers, which don't even need a person to operate them at all.</strong></p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_11507\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11507 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/lawnmower-300x153.jpg\" alt=\"robot lawn mower cutting grass\" width=\"300\" height=\"153\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Robot lawn mowers are working independently</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h3>Lawn Mower Structure and Motors</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Lawn mowers</strong> come in a range of engine and power types, with some being more economic and efficient than others. Before reviewing the motorized lawn mowers, there is the option of a reel mowers, mowers without engine that are easy to use. Most self propelled lawn mower motors have two cycle or four cycle engines, with the two cycle kind burning a mixture of petrol and oil, and the four-cycle kind burning just petrol. However, electric motors are also common, and these can be more efficient as they don't require the operator to stop and refuel. Battery powered, solar powered, rechargeable and other types of <strong>electric lawn mowers</strong> are available. Most lawn mower handlebars have a throttle, which needs to be manually pushed down in order to power the motor (a bit like the accelerator pedal in a car). This acts as a<strong> safety mechanism, as when the person performing the mowing lets go, the motor automatically cuts ou</strong>t, thus lowering the likelihood of injury. Some lawn mowers' power can be adjusted according to how hard or how many times the throttle is pushed. Lawn mower blades also vary. They can have straight or curved tips, and some are designed specifically to cut the grass into very tiny wet pieces called mulch- this mulch has agricultural and gardening uses. Therefore, electric lawn mowers can be divided into mulching or bagging mowers, depending on what they do with the grass clippings. Higher end models exist, too: 2-in-1 mulching and bagging mowers give you the choice, and 3-in-1 models allow users to decide between mulching, bagging, or a side propulsion of the waste cuttings.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_11506\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11506 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/lawn-mowers-300x143.jpg\" alt=\"electric lawn mower at work\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Electric motors or petrol motors are some of the ways to power the mowers</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h2>Used Push Lawn Mower for Sale</h2>\r\n<p>If you have a small garden or a landscaping business , push lawn mower might be the solution for you and a nice addition to your business fleet. Even though it might look as a small machine and a cheap one, that is not the case. Today's lawn mowers are advanced and it shows in the price. The best solution to get one is to buy a <strong>used push lawn mower available for sale</strong> at the second hand market or auction houses. You buy a used mower but still receive the benefits of advanced mowers from the best manufactures out there. As someone who don't need the mower for everyday use, a <strong>used push mower</strong> is the best option, cheap and reliable. </p>\r\n<h3>Top Lawn Mower Manufacturers</h3>\r\n<p>When you're buying a new piece of equipment, such as a <strong>lawn mower for sale</strong>, for your home or your business, you'll want to be sure that it's safe, durable, and up to the job. To that end, <strong>buying a used lawn mower from a trusted brand</strong> can offer some reassurance. Leading manufacturers of <strong>best cheap lawn mowers</strong> for the domestic and commercial markets include SOVEREIGN, FLYMO, QUALCAST, BOSCH, WEBB, GRIZZLY, SANLI, WOLF GARTEN, WORX, RYOBI, MTD, EINHELL, MCCULLOCH, BLACK &amp; DECKER, SEALEY, EVOPOWER, HONDA, JOHN DEERE, QGARDEN, HAYTER, HYUNDAI, DRAPER, THE HANDY, and GREENWORKS.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13428\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/john-deere-jx75.jpg\" alt=\"john deere jx75 mower\" width=\"1050\" height=\"663\" /></p></p>\r\n"},{"id":"7188_en","content":"<p>A rope hoist is a device that is intended to lift, manipulate and transport heavy objects from one location to another.

The resulting impact, and the use of the square base of the foot make it relatively easy to compact materials ranging from soil to rubble, and including sand and other possible base materials. The fast pounding action of the foot has earned the machine the name of a vibratory rammer, but all of these devices are one and the same, and all perform the same function.</p> <h2>Post Rammers for Sale</h2> <p>A post rammer uses similar mechanical technology to perform its task, but the foot is usually encased by a solid metal cylinder, which can be placed over the top of the post. The rammer foot is kept in position, enabling it to hammer the post down. There are different designs and different dimensions of post rammers for sale; some with very specific dimensions, and you should ensure that you buy the most appropriate tool.</p> <h2>Filling Holes With a Sand Rammer</h2> <p>A backfill rammer can be used to fill in deep holes, but this should be done in layers. Each layer is poured into the hole before being compacted with a compaction rammer. The next layer is then added, and the process repeated until the hole is filled. Adding too deep a layer means that the soil rammer, or sand rammer, may not be able to compact to the very bottom, and the earth will remain looser than required.</p> <h2>Trench Rammer For Sale</h2> <p>Sand rammers have many uses. They can be used to prepare ground ready for construction, to repair or maintain compacted surfaces, or as part of other construction and maintenance projects.

There are different variants of <strong>concrete screeds for sale</strong>, including manual and laser guided screeds.</p> <h2>Uses of Concrete Screeds</h2> <p>Manual <strong>floor screeders</strong> are essentially a straight piece of metal. They are dragged or pulled across the concrete surface in order to flatten, smooth, and compact the concrete. While this type of manual device may prove perfectly adequate for a small patch of concrete and a home DIY project, larger projects usually utilise a machine that does not require as much manual operation, that can compact more efficiently, and that will create a smoother and flatter surface finish. An automated <strong>concrete floor screed</strong> will do a better job, more efficiently, and more quickly than a manual screed board.</p> <h2>Vibrating Power Screed</h2> <p>The most common form of automated <strong>power screed for sale</strong> is that of the vibrating screed. This type of model has a motor and a screed blade, and the motor effectively vibrates the blade, which removes excess concrete and material to leave a smooth, flat finish. These concrete screeders typically require manual operation but they do ensure a better quality finish. However, a frame system can be used to further improve the efficiency of the machine.</p> <h2>Screed Rails</h2> <p><strong>Concrete screed rails</strong> can be used to construct a guide frame around the concrete to the desired level. When a vibrating screeder is then pulled over the surface, this helps to ensure that the concrete is perfectly level and flat. This type of system also allows for the use of mechanical screeders, potentially reducing the amount of manual work and the time taken to complete the project.</p> <h2>Laser Screed for Sale</h2> <p>A <strong>concrete laser screed</strong> is usually attached to a large vehicle and has an extending boom. The blades vibrate in order to loosen and remove the excess material, while laser sensors are used to ensure an extremely precise level and finish. When looking for used concrete screeds for sale, you should determine whether they are manual, automatic, or fully powered.</p> <h2>Concrete Screed for Sale</h2> <p>If you are looking for a <strong>used power screed for sale</strong> then some of the most popular screeder manufacturers include MEMOLON, who make a wide range of manual power screed for sale, as well as NORTHERN Industrial Tools, ALLEN Engineering, SPEEDCRETE, SOMERO, EDCO, HOVERTROWEL, RAZORBACK, HOMELITE, BELLE, and MORRISON Screed.</p>"},{"id":"7033_en","content":""},{"id":"7032_en","content":""},{"id":"7030_en","content":""},{"id":"7015_en","content":""},{"id":"7013_en","content":""},{"id":"7014_en","content":""},{"id":"7035_en","content":""},{"id":"7037_en","content":"<h3>Simple and Effective Plasma Cutting Machines</h3>\r\n<p>A <strong>plasma cutter</strong> uses inert gas, through which an electric current is passed, creating plasma from some of the gas.

There are many makes and models currently on the market, and when <strong>used plasma cutters</strong> are also considered, this further expands the selections that are available to the buyer. The simplicity of operation, and the length of time that manufacturers have had to create inexpensive <strong>plasma cutting machines</strong>, means that a DIY plasma cutter is also a viable option – especially because of the number of <strong>portable models that can be easily stored until they are needed again</strong>. Safety is important, however, because of the incredible heats that the arc nozzle will reach.</p>\r\n<h3>Plasma Cutter Mobility</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Mobility is one of the advantages of a plasma cutting machine</strong> compared to other industrial cutting machines. An air plasma cutting machine is typically a lot lighter than an oxyacetylene cutter, and it can be moved around the workshop, or even from one location to another with relative ease. However, some models and some types of plasma cutter are more portable than others, and you should consider whether you will need to regularly move the cutter when it is in use. This will help you to determine which is the best <strong>used plasma cutter</strong> for your needs, but it is only one consideration when looking at used plasma cutters for sale.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_11558\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11558 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/cnc-plasma-cutter-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"CNC plasma cutter\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">CNC plasma cutter working precise</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h4>Duty Cycle of CNC Plasma Cutter</h4>\r\n<p>The duty cycle is essentially the number of hours that the plasma CNC machine will be used without rest. In some instances, and most commonly with a <strong>CNC plasma cutter</strong>, the cutter will be on <strong>operation for longer periods of time</strong>, and this will affect the appropriate model to buy. CNC plasma cutters that are used infrequently can be purchased so that they are just capable of cutting the thickest material that needs cutting, but if the <strong>CNC plasma cutting machine</strong>, or manual cutting machine is required for longer periods of time, then it will need to offer more power output.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_26563\" style=\"width: 500px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-26563\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/KOMATSU-table-plasma-cutter.jpg\" alt=\"KOMATSU table plasma cutter\" width=\"500\" height=\"265\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOMATSU table plasma cutter</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Computer Numerical Control (CNC) means that the cutting process can be largely automated, and it is possible to <strong>ensure a precise cut as well as being able to easily change the shape, depth</strong>, and other details of the cut achieved. A <strong>CNC plasma cutter for sale</strong> will typically prove more expensive than a manual machine, but if you have the machinery and equipment, then choosing a used CNC plasma cutter can help keep costs of purchase down compared to buying new, while also potentially helping to reduce costs and workload in the future. As when buying any equipment, you should ensure that you buy a used plasma cutter that is still in good condition, and that offers the features, power requirements, and other requirements that are necessary for you.</p>\r\n<h4>Power Requirements for CNC Plasma Cutters</h4>\r\n<p>When it comes to power, it is important to consider the type of power that you are able to give the plasma cutter. Many require a large amount of power in order to be used, but there are models even of <strong>CNC plasma cutters</strong> <strong>for sale</strong> that can be operated with considerably lower power requirements. If you do not have convertors, or you are not willing to install power machinery, then you will need to ensure that you opt for the plasma cutting machine with the most appropriate power requirements.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Used Plasma Cutter for Sale</h2>\r\n<p>It is possible to keep the plasma cutting machine price down by opting for one of the many used plasma cutters for sale at second hand markets. <strong>Ensure the used cutter is in good condition</strong>, determine whether you require a used plasma cutter that DIY users can store, or used CNC plasma cutting machines that are better suited for use in workshops and for professionals including a second hand <strong>plasma cutting table</strong> for sale with a high duty cycle.

A metal polisher machine can be used to<strong> restore a sparkling shine to a tarnished ornament or chrome trimming, or simply clean up some industrial component that has become grimy through use</strong>. A particularly useful application for this kind of equipment is in the polishing of hydraulic components, where a gentle touch is needed to prevent the equipment from being rendered inoperable by the cleaning process.</p> <h2>Metal Polishing Equipment</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_26604\" style=\"width: 411px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-26604\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Stainless-steel-polishing-machie.jpg\" alt=\"Stainless steel polishing machie\" width=\"411\" height=\"438\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stainless steel polishing machie</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Metal polishing Machinery </strong>tend to come in a variety of form factors to suit different situations.

A polisher machine intended for lighter use may come in the form of a simple bench-mounted wheel. Metal polishers can also be portable. Both electric and air powered tools capable of housing a polishing abrasive wheel are regularly used in situations where it is not possible or even practical to take the item that needs polishing to fixed polishing equipment.</p> <h3>Safety Issues when Polishing Metal</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_26605\" style=\"width: 457px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-26605\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Metal-sheet-polishing-machine.jpg\" alt=\"Metal sheet polishing machine\" width=\"457\" height=\"467\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Metal sheet polishing machine</figcaption></figure> <p>Metal polishing typically involves a fast spinning wheel of abrasive material. Depending on the type of polishing being undertaken, this may be a fabric based abrasive or may simply be a wire wheel. Either way, it is important to use the machine carefully and safely, being sure to wear proper eye protection and taking great care to keep your hands clear of the wheel. Especially on bench mounted polishers, it is very easy to get the object you are polishing jammed between the wheel and the guard, which can cause mechanical problems with your equipment, if not outright injury to yourself.</p> <h2>Where to get Metal Polishing Equipment?</h2> <p>Most plant machinery or DIY metalworking  equipment providers should stock some variant of a <strong>metal polisher machine</strong>, but it is often far more practical and cost effective to seek out used metal polishing machines.

A common analogy in reference to a crank grinding machine is that the cylinder of metal is on a \"spit\" and turns much like a piece of meat would over an open fire. Of course, the forces involved with any <strong>crankshaft grinding machine</strong> must be sufficiently strong to accurately shave away layers of steel to produce the finished product.

Beginning in the 1930s, inert gases supplied in bottles were used to protect the weld area from contamination, but it was in the aircraft industry that the process was perfected when <strong>Russel Meredith</strong> created his <strong>Heliarc method</strong>. This utilised a tungsten electrode arc and helium as a shielding gas, therefore giving rise to the name of tungsten inert gas welding. Today, a tig welding machine is most often used to weld thin stainless steel sections, as well as non-ferrous metals such as copper alloys, magnesium and aluminum. Using a tig welder for aluminum is commonplace in many industries. Nowadays, intelligent welding robots are utilized for TIG/MIG welding of parts.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_10119\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10119\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/welding-robot.jpg\" alt=\"REIS SRV 16 Welding Robot\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TIG/MIG Welding Robot</figcaption></figure> <h3>The Use of the Heat Source in Tig Welding</h3> <p>The <strong>tig welding machine</strong> process requires three distinctive elements. These are heat, shielding and a filler metal. Heat is produced by a thermal arc tig welder, reaching a temperature of at least 5,000 degrees centigrade, when electricity passes through the tungsten electrode and arcs to the metal. To create this arc a high-frequency generator produces an <strong>electric spark forming a conductive path through the shielding gas between the electrode and the workpiece</strong>; a distance generally of 1.5 to 3 mm. Once the arc has been established the welding torch is moved slightly in a rotating motion to form a weld pool. While being careful to maintain an ongoing separation between the metal being worked on and the electrode, the <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/welding-machines\">welder</a></strong> tilts the torch slightly from vertical so that tig welding wire can be added to the leading edge of the weld pool as required. It requires the use of both hands as the welder manually feeds filler metal into the area being worked on while simultaneously wielding the <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/welding-torches\">welding torch</a></strong>. While using tig welders, operators tend to develop a technique whereby they rapidly alternate between adding filler metal and advancing the torch. Tungsten is used for the torch electrode due to its very high melting point; it is not consumed during the welding process. </p> <h4>Filler Metals and Shielding Gases Used with a Tig Welder</h4> <figure id=\"attachment_10120\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10120\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/tig-welding-machine.jpg\" alt=\"Power Control of a TIG Welder\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Power Adjustment in a TIG Welder</figcaption></figure> <p>Filler metals are used in most tig welding applications, although not always in the welding of some thin materials. They are available in different diameters and are made of different materials. <strong>Tig welding gas is used as a shield during the process to protect the welding area from gases such as nitrogen and oxygen</strong> in the atmosphere as these can cause weld defects such as porosity, brittleness and fusion problems if they make contact with the weld pool, arc or electrode. A shielding gas also serves other functions during the tig welding process as it transfers heat from the tig welding wire to the metal and assists in creating a stable arc. Argon is the most commonly used shielding gas as, when used with alternating current, it results in a high weld quality that also looks good. Helium is also commonly used, along with argon-helium mixtures. An <strong>inverter tig welder</strong> power source can be used for a big tig welder.</p> <h3>Used Tig Welders at Second Hand Market</h3> <p>If you are looking for a fair tig welding machine price, it is possible to purchase a full size or portable tig welder, small tig welder, tig welding gas or any other tig welder from varuous brands such as Hobart; in fact, anything to do with the tig welding process at used tig welder auctions.

An <strong>arc welding machine</strong> uses the intense heat produced by an electric arc to melt two pieces of metal so that they intermix and form a metallurgical bond</p> <h4>The Principles and Uses of Arc Welding Machines</h4> <p>An <strong>electric arc welder</strong> creates an electrical arc between an energized circuit feeding a wire electrode and the metal that is being worked on. The arc is produced when the tip of the electrode touches the metal. The electrode is withdrawn, yet still remains in close proximity to the metal and an arc is formed between the two which can produce a temperature of around 3,600 degrees Celsius. The heat from arc welding machine melts the base metal, producing a molten pool which solidifies behind the electrode as it travels along the joint, resulting in a fusion bond. The two pieces of metal may be melted to intermix directly or, more commonly, a filler metal is used. Arc welding machine's electrodes can be a rod or wire that simply conducts the current and is not consumed, or it can melt and itself supply the filler metal to the joint. The latter welding method is <strong>most common in the manufacturing of steel products</strong>. Metal arc welding results in contamination as metals at high temperatures react chemically with certain elements in the air, and so a shielding gas is used to minimize air/molten metal contact. <strong>Gas metal arc welding</strong>, commonly called <a href=\"//trademachines.com/mig-welders\"><strong>MIG Welder</strong></a>, uses a continuous-feed consumable wire which acts as both electrode and filler metal. With a submerged arc welding machine, the arc is created beneath a layer of flux to protect the weld from contamination. Gas tungsten arc welding, commonly called TIG, uses a non-consumable electrode made of tungsten and the filler metal is fed in separately. It's worth bearing in mind when searching for arc welding equipment that there are a number of other arc welding methods include carbon arc, shielded metal arc, atomic hydrogen, flux-cored arc, stud arc and electro-gas. An inverter arc welder will allow you a certain amount of versatility.</p> <p></p> <h2>The Benefits Of Buying Used Arc Welders For Sale in Auction</h2> <p>Whether you are looking for thermal <strong>arc welders for your business</strong> or a diy arc welder for home use, you will find a wide range of arc welders and arc welding supplies by browsing through used industrial equipment auctions online.

They can be found in all sorts of industries, using an automated spinning motion and a variety of technological improvements to wind materials up for packaging and shipping.</p> <h2>What Is a Winding Machine?</h2> <p>If you've ever wondered how thread, string and coil all end up nicely coiled and wrapped around a central bobbin, the answer is no longer some poor soul doing it all by hand. Simply put, the ceiling fan winding machine takes the hard work out of winding any long, thin object by spinning itself round and pulling the material in loops to make it easier to package and ship.</p> <h2>Industrial Uses of A Winding Machine</h2> <p>Winding machines can be found in many different industries and can be put to use anywhere that produces long lengths of their product that need to be stored in a compact manner. The most common types of industry using winding machines include rope, cinematic film, textiles and paper. Many electronic industries also use a coil winding machine to make it easier for their workers to use and cut the right lengths whilst they're out on the job.</p> <h2>How Does a Coil Winding Machine Work?</h2> <p>The hardest part of using a coil winding machine is getting the whole process started. Each machine will vary in how easy it is to feed the material in, but most will have a central lock at one end of the spindle. This allows the first inch or two to be fed in and clamped into place. At that point, the machinery takes over, rotating continuously at a set speed which pulls the material on. Most manufacturers feed their chosen material on at an angle to help the winding machine create an equal diamater as it goes along. This accounts for the wavy patterns you'll see on rolls of yarn or twine as well as explaining how they come out in such uniform widths.</p> <h2>The Key Features of a Winding Machine</h2> <p>Whilst there are many different types of winding machine, they all have some common features in the way that they operate:</p> <p>• <em>A central spindle</em> - Whilst the width of the bobbin will vary depending on the expected final load of the product, eachcoil winding machine will have a central spindle that is powered by electricity to create the spin. A circular spindle is used when speed is of the essence, usually in industries like textiles or paper where volume accounts for many sales, whilst a square bar provides more torque, making it the preferred shape for heavy metals and rope.</p> <p>• <em>Edge sensors</em> - In most situations, the mechanisation of the winding machines means that they are left to get on with the job once the initial feeding has been done. This means that edge sensors are essential technology as they can switch the machine off as soon as the desired diameter has been reached. They can also be used to spot any problems in the winding, such as uneven knotting or a build up in one particular part of the roll.</p> <p>• <em>Speed limits</em> - Recent years have seen a big increase in the amount of technology used on motor winding machine, in particular coil winding machines. The biggest development is variable speed limits, which allow the user to change the speed of rotation depending on what product is being wound. Coil winding machines have benefitted greatly from a variation of speed as they are the most susceptible to problems due to overheating and friction from the wire.</p>"},{"id":"7095_en","content":"<h4>The Purpose a Typical Wire Cutter Machine</h4> <figure id=\"attachment_8341\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8341\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/wcm-1-300x248.jpg\" alt=\"wire cutting machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"248\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">CNC wire cutting machine</figcaption></figure> <p>As should be expected, the uses of an automatic wire cutting machine are quite varied. One of the most common is <strong>cable processing</strong>. It should be noted that in this sense, an automatic wire cutter may also be able to handle fibre optics as well as coaxial cables; this will depend upon the parameters of the unit. However, the main function is to <strong>use an electrically charged wire</strong> (known as an electrode) to <strong>cut a programmed shape into a substrate</strong>. Some common materials produced are blanking punches and extrusion dies. These are used in a wide variety of industries including medical, industrial and aerospace sectors. Therefore, a used CNC wire cut machine for sale can be an invaluable tool.</p> <h4>The Components of a CNC Wire Cutting Machine</h4> <div id=\"textpreview\">The most important part of this unit is the wire itself; high voltage is required to literally melt grooves within a metallic surface as mentioned above. In many instances, the wire is set within a head that can adjust its angle. This allows for <strong>tapered cuts and specific angles</strong>. It is common for a wire saw cutting machine to vary slightly in terms of its physical layout but most will also contain a control panel, a viewing port and a base to hold the material in place while the cut is being made.</div> <h2>Other Benefits of a CNC Wire Cut Machine</h2> <div> <figure id=\"attachment_8346\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8346\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/wcm-2-300x149.jpg\" alt=\"wire cutter\" width=\"300\" height=\"149\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workpece is fixed and gets cut by the wire</figcaption></figure> <br /> Another facet of a typical wire cut machine revolves around the manipulation of wires themselves. A <strong>wire cutting and stripping machine</strong> is an invaluable tool within may industries, as manually performing these tasks will require a great deal of time and effort. Note here that as opposed to the wire CUTTING through a substrate, blades within the machine are intended to CUT the wire to a specific length.</div> <h2>Top Manufacturers of an Automatic Wire Cutting and Stripping Machine</h2> <div>Some of the top leaders in this industry include: <ul> <li>KOMAX </li> <li>ERASER</li> <li>ECETEK</li> <li>SCHLEUNIGER</li> <li>ARTOS</li> <li>TECHMA</li> <li>CROMA</li> <li>MARKEN</li> <li>CHMER</li> <li>GF MACHINING SOLUTIONS</li> </ul> <p>It may also be possible to obtain a used <strong>wire cut machine for sale</strong> through these providers.</p> </div> <p></p>"},{"id":"7092_en","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Robotic welding machines</strong> are designed to be used in commercial and industrial applications.

These portable models do <strong>offer more power than the consumer models</strong>, and they are built to withstand the rough treatment that portable small compressors might receive while at locations like a building site. They have to be portable, because they will not only need to be moved from job to job, but may also need to be moved around the site, too.</p> <p></p> <h3>Industrial Air Compressors</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_26371\" style=\"width: 450px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-26371\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/RIDGID-Air-Compressor.jpg\" alt=\"RIDGID Air Compressor\" width=\"450\" height=\"402\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">RIDGID Air Compressor</figcaption></figure> <p>For the biggest and most powerful <strong>industrial air compressor</strong> models are those that offer the<strong> greatest flexibility and the widest range of use</strong>. These machines are found in auto body shops, as well as in industrial warehouses and factories. Industrial air compressors are commonly fixed, or too large to be regularly moved, and they are typically not used by contractors, because they are too cumbersome, or by home users because of the high cost of most <strong>industrial air compressors for sale.</strong></p> <h2>Used Air Compressor for Sale</h2> <p>Finding an <strong>used</strong> <strong>air compressor for sale </strong>means choosing the one that fits power and tool specification requirements. Buying <strong>used air compressors</strong> enables the buyer to save money, while still being able to select from a range of high quality and the <strong>best used air compressors</strong>. COMPARE, BAUER, and ADICOMP make a selection of industrial air compressors while KAESER and METABO manufacture contractor or portable air compressors for sale that have proven reliable and robust enough to withstand the rigors of life on a construction yard. All these comressors manufacteres making the<strong> best machines out there</strong> for metal and construction fields, you can be sure to get a <strong>reliable</strong> and in <strong>good condition second hand air compressor.</strong> You can find all the information about specs avg. price and more right here on this second hand market platform.</p> <h3>Compressor Components</h3> <p>All models and sizes, whether a small air compressor or an air compressor industrial, use an engine, a storage cylinder, and a gauge. The <strong>gauge measures the pressure of the air inside the cylinder</strong>, where it is stored after the engine, which may be petrol or electric, has forced it into the tank. All parts may wear out eventually, but it is possible to replace engines and gauges, as well as finding <strong>air compressor tanks</strong> for sale. The tank must remain air-tight and no air must be allowed to leak, otherwise this compromises the level of air pressure, and renders the machine useless. When looking for a used air compressor for sale, which can provide an affordable and convenient means of <strong>buying a potentially vital but expensive piece of workshop machinery</strong>, it is important to check the overall condition of the parts including the tank.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_12357\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-12357 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/air-compressor-gauge-300x220.jpg\" alt=\"compressor gauge\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The gauge shows the pressure inside the air compressor.</figcaption></figure> <h3>Power Sources</h3> <p>Although most <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/compressors\">compressors for sale</a> </strong>operate from the mains, some gas or diesel models are portable enough that they can be kept in the trunk of the car. This offers a simple and effective way to inflate tires, even at the side of the road. For the mobile mechanic, this type of portable air compressor offers similar benefits, and there are a number of<strong> used air compressors</strong> <strong>for sale</strong> that have been designed with portability as well as power in mind. It is important that the buyer considers their power source, as well as other factors, because if they do not have the appropriate power source, then the air compressor will not work efficiently. <strong>Portable compressors</strong> should typically work on gasoline, because of the lack of availability of an electricity source, but gasoline powered compressors should only be used in ventilated areas in order to ensure the safety of the user.</p> <h3>Matching Compressor To Requirements</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_12360\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-12360 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Pneumatic-air-comressor-300x185.jpg\" alt=\"champion air compressor\" width=\"300\" height=\"185\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Air compressors can also be used at home.</figcaption></figure> <p>One factor that every buyer should consider before investing in <strong>used air compressors</strong>, is that the <strong>performance rating of the tools</strong> they will be using. The buyer should thus <strong>match the power of the air compressor to the power requirements of their tools</strong>, otherwise the tools will be inefficient or not work at all.</p> <h4>Hand Carts and Portability of a Air Compressor</h4> <p>When buying a <strong>used air compressor</strong>, it is worth noting that some will include a hand cart because while it may be possible to move them by hand, they can still be very heavy and the assistance of the hand cart can prove invaluable. For most commercial buyers, the <strong>size of the tank and the horsepower of the air compressor for sale </strong>will prove more important than the cost of buying, and most commercial operations will be able to provide the level and type of power that the compressor needs. Quality, durability, and power should all be considered important factors for <strong>air compressor sales</strong>.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13157\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/clarke-air.jpg\" alt=\"clarke air compressor\" width=\"1492\" height=\"953\" /></p>"},{"id":"7142_en","content":"<h2>Concrete Mixers and Cement Mixers</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_11618\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11618\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Concrete-Mixer-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"Portable concrete mixer in use\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Portable concrete mixer preparing concrete</figcaption></figure> <p>A <strong>concrete mixer</strong>, also known as a cement mixer, uses a revolving drum to mix cement with water and an aggregate material such as gravel or sand. This is one of the essential machines in<strong> <a href=\"//trademachines.com/road-construction-machinery\">road construction equipment</a></strong> and building construction materials. Concrete mixers can be large and truck-mounted or small and portable.</p> <h2>The Types Of Concrete Mixers</h2> <p>The first concrete mixing machine was invented in 1905 by the <strong>industrialist Gebhardt Jaeger</strong>, but since then different types of both stationary and mobile mixers have evolved to address the considerable worldwide demand for consistent mixes. However, <strong>three types of concrete mixers</strong> are predominant in today's industrial world.</p> <p>The type of concrete mixer machine with the lowest maintenance and operating costs is the <strong>drum mixer</strong>, used for larger volumes. The high production speed of this kind of mixer makes it a market leader in the ready-mixed arena as it helps to drive down costs. Twin shaft mixers are generally used for high strength cement production and offer short mixing times.</p> <p><strong>Vertical axis mixers</strong> are predominantly used for pre-stressed and precast concrete, and because they can be efficiently and relatively easily cleaned between batches they are excellent for coloured concrete. The vertical axis concrete pan mixer is gradually being supplanted by the planetary, otherwise known as counter-current, mixer, so that the former can now often be found for a reasonable price on the used cement mixer market.</p> <p><strong>In-transit concrete mixers</strong>, invented by Stephen Stepanian in the early 20th century, have been adopted worldwide as a means of transporting and mixing cement and delivering it to construction sites.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11624\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-11624\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/cement-mixer-for-sale-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"vertical axis mixer for cement\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vertical axis mixer in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <p>These are very efficient as the mixing can be performed during transport on the back of the truck. Alternatively, a volumetric concrete mixer can be used. These are trucks containing the necessary ingredients to be mixed as and when required. <strong>Concrete pumps</strong> can be used to take the concrete to where it is required if the truck cannot get close enough. However, it is often the case that large amounts of cement are not required, in which case it is more cost-effective to use one of the many models of <strong>portable concrete mixer</strong> that are available. These typically use a small revolving drum into which the component materials are placed for the mixing process. Such a <strong>mobile concrete mixer</strong> may be powered by petrol engines, or an electric concrete mixer might be used.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11626\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11626 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/concrete-mixers-300x164.jpg\" alt=\"vertical axis mixer as attachment for tractor\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A concrete mixer can be attached at a tractor</figcaption></figure> <h2>Used Concrete Mixer For Sale At Auction Is the Best Option</h2> <p>Whether you are looking for a small concrete mixer for domestic, hobby or small business use, or a volumetric concrete mixer for sale to boost the speed and efficiency of your construction business, then you can find all you need in the used concrete mixer market.

Connected to a flexible hose which can be extended for some distance, it allows the concrete to be moved to difficult locations such as multi storey buildings.</p> <h2>The Types Of Concrete Pumps</h2> <p>Liquid concrete can often be tipped out of a concrete mixer straight to where it is required, but often the desired location is inaccessible by means of this method, and the concrete requires assistance to get where it needs to be. This is where concrete pumps come in. However, concrete presents many challenges to pump manufacturers and can place a great strain on <a href=\"//trademachines.com/concrete-equipment\"><strong>concrete pumping equipment</strong></a>. It has a tendency to solidify if it is not kept agitated. It is also abrasive, generally contains some very hard pieces of rock, and is both heavy, thick and sticky. Piston pumps are generally used to keep this difficult substance in motion, as they can exert a great deal of pressure in pushing cylinders of concrete mixes. One type of concrete pump is the <strong>trailer concrete pump</strong>. This uses an articulating robot arm boom which is operated by remote control for accurate placement. Such boom concrete pumps are capable of dealing with high volumes. The other major type of concrete pump is known as a truck-mounted concrete pump, or line pump. With this type, linked hoses are manually attached to the machine's outlet and placed where they need to be. This is a slightly more labour intensive method that is generally used for smaller volumes. A skid mounted small concrete pump can also be used in places of particularly limited access, such as mines. When <strong>looking for <a href=\"//trademachines.com/concrete-pumps\">used concrete pumps</a></strong> it's advisable to determine your exact requirements before purchasing. You need to consider what kind of portable concrete pump would be most suitable for your business, taking into account such factors as horizontal and vertical boom reach, pumping rate, concrete pressure, cylinder length and diameter and the number of outrigger legs.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_13601\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-13601 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/reed-concrete-pump-300x190.jpg\" alt=\"reed concrete pump\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trailer concrete pumps can be moved from location to location</figcaption></figure> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Try Online Auctions For Tracking Down Concrete Pumps For Sale</h2> <p>If you are looking for a concrete pump or concrete pump trucks for sale, you vastly increase your chances of finding exactly what you need by checking out the wide range offered for sale on online auction sites. This will give you the widest possible overview of used concrete pumps for sale. In addition to the sheer range of availability, you'll also find that there are some real bargains to be enjoyed.

It also allows for a cheaper operation, as many formations can be reached from one drilling platform, unlike with vertical drilling where a drill would have to be placed directly over the formation. This technology allows for reservoirs to be tapped by a single drilling location, even if that location is miles away from the reservoir itself. Horizontal directional drilling equipment allows for the drilling of wells at up to eighty degree angles. Using a <strong>horizontal directional drilling machine</strong> can also allow for the drilling of wells or holes under obstacles, such as bodies of water. Horizontal drilling can also be used to pull a medium (such as piping) through the hole it has drilled.</p> <h2>Directional Drills for Sale</h2> <p><strong>Directional drilling machines for sale</strong> are not hard to come by. Like so many other big industrial machines, they tend to be purchased for large jobs and then sold on to recover some of the costs.

These components are <strong>a diffuser, a compressor wheel and housing</strong>. Air is drawn into the compressor axially with the rotational speed of the wheel and is then accelerated to a high velocity before being expelled in the radial direction. The function of the diffuser is to slow the speed of the high velocity air so that both the temperature and pressure increase. The diffuser is created by the backplate of the <a href=\"//trademachines.com/compressors\"><strong>used compressor</strong></a> and part of the volute housing.

This enables the material to be easily transported and stored, minimising the amount of work required to move materials from one place to another. A bale press machine consists of an engine, a hopper (or container) to contain the material and a hydraulic arm which squeezes the material either horizontally or vertically to achieve a more regular shape.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_10428\" style=\"width: 289px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-10428\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/baling-press-machine.jpg\" alt=\"press hay to bales with a tractor attached press\" width=\"289\" height=\"159\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Round baling press for hay in use</figcaption></figure></p> <h2>Different types of baling presses</h2> <p>The material requiring compression frequently determines the type of <strong>hydraulic baling press</strong> which is most appropriate. A scrap baling press, for example, will be used to crush waste metal, textiles, card, paper or other materials which are commonly recycled. A hydraulic bale press machine may also be a scrap baler or used to shape hay bales or other agricultural products. A number of different sizes are available, as well as hydraulic arms which offer varying levels of pressure. Balers may be portable and also optimised to produce bales which are optimised for subsequent HGV transport.</p> <h2>Major hydraulic bale press machine manufacturers</h2> <p>HSM is a British manufacturer who produces a wide selection of <strong>bale press machines</strong>, including mobile models, energy efficient machines and those suitable for baling dense, heavy items. APOLLO has an international presence and specialises in baling press products which can either stand alone or form part of an entire system. A hydraulic baling press machine from APOLLO is particularly suitable for use in manufacturing or in a recycling plant, where an integrated system is required to successfully process large volumes of materials.</p></p></p>"},{"id":"7171_en","content":"<figure id=\"attachment_8956\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8956 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/ch-1-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"chain harrow\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chain harrows have many different purposes and uses</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Chain harrows</strong> are used as<a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\"> </a><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\">farm machinery</a></strong> , <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/garden-and-urban-equipment\">garden machinery</a></strong>, equestrian centers and sports grounds for removing thatch, spreading dung, breaking up sods and <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/fertilisingplant-protection-equipment\">fertilizer</a></strong>, covering seed as well as for leveling.

There are different types of air handlers. Terminal units are small air handlers designed for local use. Packaged units (also rooftop units) are bigger and used outdoors. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An air handling unit consists of many parts. Filters are responsible for providing clean air. Humidifier prevents the air from being too dry, when the blower’s task is to move the air at a certain flow rate. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is the difference between an air conditioner and air handler?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Air handlers are machines distributing conditioned air throughout a room, when air conditioners remove the heat from indoor air and carry it outside. Unlike air handling units, air conditioner is located outside a building. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How much is an air handler?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Air handlers’ prices range from $500 to $3,500. Remember about installation costs on top of that. If you are looking for a cost effective solution, have a look at the second market. Air handlers are durable machines, which last up to 20 years. Buying a used air handler will deliver you great performance for a much lower cost. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are the leading air handler manufacturers?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are looking for the best air handler manufacturers and their leading models, have a look at the table below. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"width: 170px\">\r\n<p><b>Manufacturer</b></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"width: 200px\">\r\n<p><b>Model</b></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kaeser</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kaeser TE 121</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kaeser TA 5</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kaeser Airtower 19</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Waukesha</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Waukesha 10</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Waukesha 15</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Waukesha 60</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heraeus</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heraeus HM 13</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Goulds </span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Goulds 3175</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Find the best selection of used air handlers on Trademachines!</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Are you looking for air handlers for sale?

Forage consists of plant stems consumed by grazing livestock. Fodder refers to the food that is specifically given to the animals such as calf feeding equipment or sheep feeding equipment, rather than that which they forage for themselves. This includes straw, silage, hay, sprouted grains and legumes, pelleted feeds and other mixed rations. To help with the distribution of fodder, there is a wide range of <strong>farm and livestock feeding equipment</strong> available from noted manufacturers, many of which boast decades of experience and expertise. The <strong>KVERNELAND Taarup 600 series of diet feeders</strong> has an excellent reputation in the agricultural industry. It has a two contra-rotation auger system and a highly accurate weighing system that results in a quality, homogeneous feed material. It is especially designed to incorporate all feed formats into the ration without any pre-chopping requirement. The <strong>WATSON feeding trailer</strong> is a very popular item of equipment that is in demand on the used feeding equipment market. It is capable of feeding thirty to forty cattle and has an all steel construction throughout. The <strong>SHELBOURNE REYNOLDS Powermix Pro range of complete diet feeders</strong> have a range of sizes and feed out options to suit just about any farm and are highly sought after by those looking to buy used feeding equipment.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9366\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-9366\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/fe-2-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"Portable feeding equipment\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Portable cattle feeding equipment</figcaption></figure> <p>These have a uniquely designed central auger and are easy to use and maintain. <strong>APACHE</strong> is another well respected name in the field of feeding equipment, and the company's range of creep, self and specialty feeders are the only ones available boasting a lid opener that lifts the lid into an erect position so that it acts as a wind shield when the feeder is filling. The <strong>APACHE Range Feeders</strong> are also known to be a quality product. The <strong>KEENAN MF</strong> range of intelligent mixer wagons incorporate advanced mechanical and electronic engineering and yet offer a simplicity of operation that makes these <strong>adaptive feeding equipment very popular</strong>. IAE offer an extensive and proven range of<strong> portable cattle feeding equipment,</strong> including circular, high density and 2 in 1 units as well as excellent cattle feed barriers including dovetail, euroyoke and diagonal.</p> <h2>What Are The Advantages Of Buying Used Feeding Equipment?</h2> <p>The cost of new feeding equipment can be quite prohibitive, so you may find that a preferable option is to look to buy used feed trucks and feed machinery at a greatly reduced cost. Thanks to the <strong>robust and durable construction</strong> of farm feeding equipment such as feed trucks, feed mills, feed mixers, etc, you know that you will be looking at sound items that will last a good many years when you check out the range of bargains available on used feed equipment auctions.</p> <h2>Feed Equipment Manufacturers</h2> <p>There are several companies producing agricultural feeding equipment with an excellent reputation for the reliability of their goods. These are naturally extremely popular on the used feeding equipment market. Among them are APACHE, IAE, KEENAN, KUHN, KVERNELAND, MCHALE, NEW HOLLAND, POTTINGER, SHELBOURNE REYNOLDS and WATSON.</p> <p></p></p>"},{"id":"1218_en","content":"<p><p><b>Other products in

organisms with a tractor drawn sprayer</figcaption></figure> <p>Sprayers are used in the farming sector to <strong>deliver pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and defoliants to their biological targets</strong>. These remove undesirable organisms and help the crop to gain the maximum of water, nutrients and sunlight. There are numerous kinds of machine operated agricultural sprayers, including high pressure, low pressure, air-carrier and fogger variants, available from a number of agricultural sprayers manufacturers. <strong>Some are light enough to be mounted on the back of the spray operator</strong> and operated manually, whereas others are tractor mounted or tractor drawn. Self-propelled sprayers are also available, with multi nozzle booms, and tanks as large as 1,600 gallons. Typically, agricultural sprayers are comprised of a tank, pump, filters, boom and nozzles. You will find that the most commonly used agricultural sprayers for application in the fields are the low pressure sprayers. If you are looking for agricultural sprayers for sale, then you might wish to bear in mind that used agricultural sprayers can be purchased, at a fraction of the cost of new ones, from online farm machinery auctions. Here you can choose from a wide selection of agricultural sprayers for sale and compare prices so as to find the best deal for your requirements. Many farmers hire a commercial applicator, but buying used agricultural sprayers means that for a relatively small outlay you can operate your own and therefore target the application for the right agronomic moment, knowing that the job will be done right. <strong>Some of the most popular agricultural sprayer manufacturers include John Deere, AGCO, New Holland, GVM, Buhler Versatile and Case IH</strong>. All of these manufacturers and more have models that are regularly available at the online used <a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\"><strong>agricultural machinery auctions</strong></a>, where you will be paying far less than you would if you purchased new equipment.</p> <h2>Used Agricultural Sprayers</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_7481\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7481 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/Spr-1-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"tractor drawn sprayer\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sprayer towed behind a tractor</figcaption></figure> <p>Self-propelled sprayer units similar to tractors, having boom mounts of around 18 to 46 metres in length, are widely available from a wide selection of manufacturers. Some even have damped booms to reduce bounce and complex telemetry systems. As you know, such technology does not come cheap, but you can lower the cost to your business considerably by buying used self-propelled sprayers from online farm equipment equipment auctions. <strong>Also available are used field sprayers that can be mounted on the back of a tractor or towed behind.</strong> These may have different boom and pump options, in addition to various accessories, so that they can be configured according to your needs.

agricultural industries like farms involves <strong>cutting grass into swathes</strong>, using a <strong>silage cutter</strong>, and leaving it to wilt; a <strong>silage chopper</strong> then <strong>chops and blows the forage into a trailer</strong> which transports it to where it is baled and eventually opened using a silage block or bale cutter. </p> <figure id=\"attachment_10513\"

<strong>silage machine</strong> is attached to a <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\">tractor</a></strong> and the trailer to a separate tractor. After being picked up from the swathe the grass is chopped into 7cm lengths by knives on the rotor and chopper. It is then blown through the chute into a trailer by hydraulic control.</p> <h2>Advantages of Buying Used Silage Cutters </h2> <p>Buying <strong>used silage cutters at auction</strong> is one way to reduce your expenses.

A <strong>wooden hay rake</strong>, for example, is a handheld version (similar to a typical household brush) that is only really suitable for small areas. Moving up in scale, a <strong>small hay rake</strong> can be pushed by hand, or even towed by a modest vehicle. A <strong>rotary hay rake</strong> on the other hand will tend to be for much larger operations covering entire fields and will require a tractor to operate. Regardless of the type, the functionality is much the same; the hay rake teeth (also known as hay rake tines) push the hay around to the desired arrangement (the aforementioned windrows, usually). The difference being how much the user has to do, for example pushing an old hay rake around by hand as opposed to simply driving a wheel hay rake around and letting it take care of everything.</p> <h2>Buying Used Hay Rakes</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_8404\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8404 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/hr-2-300x135.jpg\" alt=\"Hay rake tines\" width=\"300\" height=\"135\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hay rakes requires tractors to operate</figcaption></figure> <p>Old hay rakes for sale are a boon small farming operations in an economy that is already squeezing the agricultural industry particularly hard.

the 1860s that lawn mower manufacture took off. There is now a <strong>tremendous variety available,</strong> and if you are looking to buy a mower it's best to spend some time thinking about the type most suitable to your needs. <strong>Cylinder mowers are available in electric or hand push versions</strong>. Hover mowers are lightweight and easy to manoeuvre and so ideal for uneven surfaces and slopes. Wheeled, electric rotary mowers might be the best option for the average family lawn. Larger areas are best tackled with <strong>petrol mowers,</strong> which can be self-propelling, or ride on models. <strong>Robotic mowers</strong> can be left to get on with the job with <strong>little supervision.</strong> When it comes to the top manufacturers, the HAYTER brand is synonymous with professional standard grass cutting and has been for over fifty years. MOUNTFIELD is renowned for the quality and reliability of their mowers. The JOHN DEERE mowers are also highly regarded. BRIGGS &amp; STRATTON are the leading manufacturer stateside.

agriculture</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Balers</strong> are part of hay equipment in agricultural machinery that are used for the compression of a harvested crop, forming it into compact bales that can be handled, transported and stored with comparative ease. Crops such as cut straw, hay or silage can be dealt with in this way. Bales produced by hay balers may be square/rectangular or round/cylindrical and of various sizes, and can be bound in a variety of ways. Balers might use straps, twine, wire or even netting to maintain the bale in its proper shape. There are numerous makes of balers for sale, so the buyer has to decide which is the most suitable for their purposes. However, new models can prove costly, so it's worth giving some thought to acquiring a <strong>hay baler for sale</strong>. Balers, by the very nature of the task they are required to perform, are strong pieces of machinery, and tend to be sold on only when the previous owner requires an upgrade. Therefore you can look through the selection of used balers for sale with confidence, knowing that you'll be acquiring a robust item of farm machinery that will give you years of good service. Buying used balers is a great way to save money and the best place to look for <strong>hay balers for sale</strong> at <a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\"><strong>online used farm equipment auctions</strong></a>. Here you will be able to choose from a wide and reasonably priced selection of used balers for sale, and with so many options the chances of finding a used baler for sale are greatly increased. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Round Balers</strong></li> </ul> <p>The most common types of balers used in industrialised farming today are round balers. These produce <strong>cylindrical bales</strong> which are particularly effective at withstanding inclement weather as they tend to shed water. Depending on the size and material of the bale and its moisture content, round balers for sale can weigh from 500 to 1,000 kg and have dimensions of up to 180 cm in diameter and 150 cm in width. Used round balers for sale often come on to the market and can be purchased for a fraction of the price of new equipment. </p> <figure id=\"attachment_7462\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<a href=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/10/ball_wrapper_2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-7462 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/10/ball_wrapper_2-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"square baler in action\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Square baler in action</figcaption></figure> <ul> <li><strong>Square Balers</strong></li> </ul> <p>Another commonly used baler is a square baler. These produce bales that are generally more highly compacted than round bales, and are easier to stack and transport, and also take up less space in storage. There are square balers available that produce smaller bales, capable of being handled manually, but these are predominantly found on small acreage farms. Many <strong>square balers</strong> are designed to follow directly behind the tractor in the same way as round balers. A surprising number of older used square balers for sale find their way on to the used farm machinery auction market and despite their age may be in excellent condition. Such auctions allow for an excellent overview of what's available, so that you can track down a baler bargain.</p> <p>Several top manufacturers offer a variety of models like Vermeer and McHale. Some create round bales of hay, grass or wheat. Others like the Band-it machine use a square design. <strong>Bale wrappers are available as mounted or trailed versions</strong>. The machine is pulled behind a truck like the Kuhn models and the hay wraps around into a round bale.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Used Balers and Best Bargains</strong></h2> <p>Buying <strong>used hay </strong><strong>balers </strong>at online auctions is just one way to replace equipment or expand your farm. When you start wrapping up grass, wheat, and other similar products into bales. In used equipment auctions on TradeMachines, you can find used hay balers for sale, which are tested to ensure working condition. You also have the advantage of buying<strong> used balers </strong>at affordable prices. </p> <h2><strong>Baler Manufacturers<br /> </strong></h2> <p>Major manufacturers of <strong>balers at auction </strong>provide durable and high quality machines.

offers a wide range of machinery for domestic use</figcaption></figure></p> <p>Much of the <strong>garden machinery</strong> still used by gardeners today is descended from some of the earliest agricultural tools used by man. Agricultural implements such as the spade, shovel, fork, pitchfork, rake, hand trowel, hand cultivator, and hoe can all be traced back into prehistory. Today added to these perennial favourites are various <strong>time and labour saving powered garden equipment</strong> items that have become compact and convenient enough for domestic use, including mower, sprinklers, hedge trimmers, strimmers, cultivators, chain saws, lawn aerators, scarifiers, leaf blowers, vacuums, trenchers, mini--tractors and chainsaws. However, the most important item of gardening equipment is still the spade. It should be something that is personal to you, and it's well worth finding a top quality one that will last a lifetime. The range of garden tools produced by BULLDOG is noted for superior quality and reliability. Established in 1780, they are the UK's leading makers of gardening equipment. Japanese TOBISHO secateurs are second to none. FISKARS produce top quality shears. Many gardeners swear by the excellence of the BLACK &amp; DECKER and WORKX ranges of <strong>garden machinery &amp; power tools</strong>.</p> <h2>Used Garden Tools at Auctions</h2> <p><figure id=\"attachment_7636\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7636 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/sweaper_in_use-300x170-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"Urban cleaning equipmet\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Find used urban cleaning equipment in online auctions</figcaption></figure></p> <p>If you're looking to buy <strong>garden machinery and urban equipment</strong>, you would be well advised to check out the depth and variety available at used garden equipment auctions.

height=\"227\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fully loaded forwarder</figcaption></figure> <h2>The Role of Used Forwarders in Your Business</h2> <p>The <strong>forestry forwarder</strong>, unlike the skidder which drags the logs, picks the logs up clear of the ground in order to move them, and forestry forwarders can vary from the smaller designs that are meant to be towed behind an all-terrain vehicle to much larger, self-contained units. When looking for a<strong> used forwarders for sale</strong>, it is important that you choose the appropriate wood forwarder machine, and most <strong>log forwarders for sale</strong> are classified by the load that they can carry. <strong>Used forwarders</strong> are thus part of <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/forestry-equipment\">forestry equipment</a></strong>.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_12702\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-12702\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/forwardersnow-300x164.jpg\" alt=\"logging forwarders\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forwarders can work in different weather conditions</figcaption></figure> <h2>Restricted or Protected Access</h2> <p>Forestry forwarders are not able to carry the same kind of load as skidders, but they do limit damage to the soil. If access is restricted, felling is being performed on a selection of trees rather than a whole forest, or if conservation is vital, then choosing a high quality <strong>logging forwarder for sale</strong>, rather than a skidder, is the preferred option.</p> <h2>Models and Limits of Forestry F<strong>orwarders </strong></h2> <p>Small <strong>forwarders for sale</strong> will typically cope with loads of up to half a tonne, whereas logging forwarders designed to be towed by <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\">tractors</a></strong> can carry as much as 4 tonnes. Small purpose-built machines will manage up to 8 tonnes, medium machines up to 12 tonnes and a large, heavy-duty forwarder can carry as much as 20 tonnes of load. These differences make it vital that you choose the most appropriate <strong>log forwarder for sale</strong> – placing too much load on the forwarder forestry may lead to damage to the logging equipment, and it could pose a hazard to those operating it.</p> <p></p> <h2>Choosing a Used Forestry Forwarder</h2> <p>Determine whether you need a trailer model or a purpose-built forestry forwarders, and calculate the weight of the logs. Purpose-built machines from VALMET, JOHN DEERE, PONSEE, PROSILVE, and TIMBERJACK can all help ensure that the job of felling and moving logs is easier, safer, and more efficient.

<strong>slope mowers</strong> available at industrial machinery auctions can be found in a variety of styles such as steep slope mower and remote controlled slope mower.</p> <h2><strong>Popular Manufacturers and Models of Slope Mowers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Used slope mowers</strong> like Spider, John Deere, KutKwick, Ventrac, ATM Slope Mower and Alamo Industrial are able to handle a graded slope versus flat lawn service. There are several models within these different manufacturers to ensure the work is done properly, with a close cut. For example the Spider ILD01 is a radio controlled slope mower versus the KutKwick SuperSlopeMaster, which is a riding lawn mower. The KutKwick can handle grades of 40 degrees. The ATM Slope Mower 72 LC works on 34 degree slopes with a 72 inch deck (cutting width).</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Used Slope Mowers</strong></h2> <p>Buying a<strong> used slope mower </strong>at auction or from previous owners are two ways to locate these machines at an affordable cost. When shopping slope cutting mowers it is best to purchase from a reputable company. Not all <strong>used slope mowers for sale </strong> will be the same quality. Some may have rust, engine issues, or dull blades. Check these aspects before purchasing a used slope mower.</p> <h2><strong>Slope Mowers in Auctions</strong></h2> <figure id=\"attachment_8397\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8397\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/11/sm-2-300x179.jpg\" alt=\"mower for slopes\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Steep slope or banks  are all the same for a slope mower</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Slope mower auctions</strong> make it possible for you to find used machines at cost. At used slope mowers auctions a base price is set. This means you could purchase a<strong> slope mower for sale</strong> at this low price or have competition to bid against. Make certain you have an account with proper funding on the auction day. Also you may wish to have more than one machine in your sight as a way to bid successfully and get your slope mower.</p> <h2><strong>Manufacturers of Slope Mowers</strong></h2> <p>Top manufacturers to choose from include: KUTKWICK, VENTRAC, ATM, ALAMO INDUSTRIAL, SPIDER, JOHN DEERE, and KUBOTA. These manufacturers are known for their durable, high quality slope mowers, including steep slope mowers and slope mowers radio controlled.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13331\"

alt=\"Hurricane tree stump grinder\" width=\"300\" height=\"153\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hurricane grinding the tree stump</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Stump Grinder Types &amp; Uses</h2>\n<p>When a tree has been felled, the removal of the remaining stump can often prove to be quite problematic. A powered tree stump grinder is the best and most effective option. The most commonly used type of stump grinder is fitted with a wheel set with fixed carbide teeth. This rotates rapidly and reduces the <strong>stump wood</strong> to small chips. Hydraulic cylinders are used to raise and lower the cutting wheel and move it laterally across the surface of the stump, grinding it down to the desired level. A tree grinder or stump grinder can be as small as a lawn mower or as large as a car or van. Some are designed as attachments that can be fitted to tractors or excavators. Small jobs can be tackled with a 13 or 14 hp model that is light and maneuverable. Larger models, such as those used in the forestry sector, are often self-propelled and may have a diesel engine. These are controlled either by a manual control panel or may it be radio controlled so that the operator can stand at a safe distance. Some <strong>stump grinders</strong> are fitted with removable grinding teeth which can be replaced without the necessity of changing the wheel.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7619\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7619\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/TORO_depot_stump_grinder-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Stump grinder for home use\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TORO home stump grinder in use</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Rayco, Vermeer - Stump Grinders from Top-Manufacturers</h2>\n<p>On TradeMachines you'll find a great selection of stump grinders from well-known manufacturers. The brand RAYCO is known for the quality and dependability of the stump grinding machines they produce, from their Mini Workforce range up to the very powerful RG 100. Vermeer models are also in high demand, VERMEER SC 852, for example, is designed for an excellent balance of power and agility and has an all-wheel drive and variable speed.</p>\n<p><img

width=\"300\" height=\"217\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sweeper cleaning the street after a city marathon</figcaption></figure> <h2>The Range of Sweeping Machines</h2> <p>A <strong>road sweeper</strong> has to <strong>contend with a range of different roads surfaces</strong>, road conditions, and types of dirt and debris. The sweeper truck itself must be able to cope with tight cornering, and while larger <strong>street sweepers for sale</strong> are well-suited to collecting large volumes of trash without having to stop and unload, they can prove too cumbersome and bulky for some applications. In these circumstances, a smaller, electric sweeper may be better suited to the task at hand, while choosing the most appropriate sweeper technology will help ensure the best dirt collection results.</p> <h3>Types of Street Sweepers</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_24054\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-24054 size-full\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/PIQUERSA-street-vacuum-sweeper.jpg\" alt=\"PIQUERSA street vacuum sweeper\" width=\"350\" height=\"307\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">PIQUERSA street vacuum sweeper</figcaption></figure> <ul> <li> <h5> <em>Mechanical</em></h5> </li> </ul> <p>The <strong>traditional</strong> <strong>floor sweeper</strong> uses a <strong>mechanical broom</strong> to literally sweep dirt and debris onto a conveyor and into a storage tank. This type of sweeper machine may struggle over bumpy, rough, or poorly maintained road surfaces, but is usually the least expensive to purchase and can prove effective for short runs over car parks and smooth, flat surfaces. However, these road sweepers in action do tend to miss smaller dust particles so may leave the area dusty, and will not usually prove suitable for sandy or dirty areas.</p> <ul> <li> <h5><em>Regenerative </em></h5> </li> </ul> <p>A <strong>regenerative</strong> <strong>street sweeper truck</strong> uses a<strong> continuous flow of air</strong> that initially blasts dirt and debris off the ground and into the air cycle. Debris is contained completely within the unit, so if you are looking for <strong>road sweepers for sale</strong> that will completely clear an area without blasting debris back into the local atmosphere, these could be a good choice.</p> <ul> <li> <h5><em>Pure Vacuum</em></h5> </li> </ul> <p>There are also <strong>pure vacuum sweeper trucks</strong> for sale that basically operate like a giant motorised vacuum. Brushes may be used to sweep the debris up, and additional brooms may be used to prevent the majority of debris from being vented back into the atmosphere. One of the uses of this type of sweeper is as a parking lot vacuum sweeper. This type of automatic sweeper is highly effective right under the nozzle, and it can be used on damaged and uneven road surfaces. Buyers that are looking for a reliable, all-round model of road sweeper machine should consider pure vacuum models.</p> <h4>All-Rounder or a Fleet of Road Sweepers for sale</h4> <figure id=\"attachment_12523\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-12523 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/street-sweeper-300x194.jpg\" alt=\"road sweeper\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Municipal road sweeper cleaning the street.</figcaption></figure> <p>The differing conditions, and access to the different types of industrial floor sweeper available such as <strong>regular road sweeper</strong> or if he finds a <strong>mini road sweeper for sale</strong> a mean that many fleet owners have to decide whether to buy different models of <strong>used street sweepers for sale</strong> for different applications, or look for a single street sweeper vehicle that can meet and combat all of the challenges that may lie ahead.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_24057\" style=\"width: 450px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-24057\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/JOHNSTON-road-sweeper.jpg\" alt=\"JOHNSTON road sweeper\" width=\"450\" height=\"314\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">JOHNSTON road sweeper can sweep streets, parking lots and other heavy duty tasks</figcaption></figure> <h4>Water Vs. Waterless Models</h4> <p>Another decision that buyers need to make is whether to opt for a water or waterless road sweeper truck. You can find a <strong>good variety of both types of road sweepers for sale</strong>, and a lot of fleet managers and sweeper owners in cold environments opt for the waterless version. There is no danger of the water tank freezing, and you will not leave a blanket of ice behind after cleaning the road surfaces.</p> <h2>Used Road Sweepers Planing</h2> <p>There are other options to consider, and decisions to make when looking for a second hand <strong>street sweeper for sale</strong>. Alternative fuel is becoming more popular than the traditional diesel model, while quiet sweepers are used when cleaning needs to be done at night or early in the morning, and the owner does not wish to <strong>upset</strong> or <strong>rouse locals.</strong> It is also worth <strong>considering</strong> that the <strong>cost</strong> of used <strong>sweepers</strong> means that a routine and <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong> plan should be set up in order to prolong the life of the sweeper, and some used small street sweepers for sale are better suited to easy maintenance than others.</p> <p></p> <h4>Street Sweepers Manufacturers </h4> <p>There are a number of companies that specialise in the manufacture and supply of high quality sweeper machines and <strong>industrial sweepers</strong>. ELGIN, TYMCO, SCHWARZE, KARCHER, FMC, TENNANT, MOBIL, SCARAB, HAKO, CEKSAN and MADVAC are among some of the best known names in the sweeper manufacturing industry, as well as JOHNSTON street sweepers.

The cost of recharging the battery overnight on low rate tariff is considerably lesser than replacing gas bottles or filling a tank with diesel fuel. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Electric fork lift trucks are generally </span><b>easier to drive</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> than engine powered machines, because they only have an accelerator and a brake pedal. There is no clutch pedal or inching pedal. In the design of the electric forklift, braking happens automatically and electrically as soon as the operator’s foot is removed from the gas pedal resulting in less brake wear. </span></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33759 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/4-wheeled-electric-forklift-300x194.jpg\" alt=\"4 wheeled electric forklift\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Higher </span><b>initial cost</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, because of battery and charger is a major disadvantage with the usage of electric forklifts. They are also unavailable for use while the </span><b>battery is being recharged</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, unless additional batteries for multi-shift working are available which adds further to the cost, and space must be found for the battery charging station, and a suitable means of changing batteries provided, at shift change-over. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Electric forklifts need a better floor surface to work on because the higher point loadings on the axles and wheels can cause them to sink in hard standing. Electric forklifts are not really suitable for prolonged use outside during wet weather, because the damp atmosphere causes problems with wiring circuitry and electrical components.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4 Wheeled Forklifts vs. 3 Wheeled Forklifts</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A </span><b>4 wheel electric forklift</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has a single steering wheel on the rear of its each corner with a dual acting hydraulic ram. Four wheel electric forklifts come with either cushion or pneumatic tires. They provide better stability and it works well for turning with a heavy load. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The four wheel forklifts are known for being better for </span><b>gradeability</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. It is essential for a company that needs to manage large warehouses to move </span><b>heavy equipment and machinery</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> around steep areas. Thus  4 wheel forklifts are preferable for companies with large capacity needs and rough flooring areas. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The load carrying capacity of the 4 wheel electric forklifts is also way bigger than that of the three wheel electric forklifts. With capacities ranging from 1600kg-8000kg the four wheel electric forklifts can be used for specialist heavy lifting applications such as machinery and tool installation including presses, dies &amp; jigs. But, the major limitation of the four wheel forklift is their larger turning circle which makes them less manoeuvrable in a space constrained location.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Buying and Selling of used 4-wheel electric forklifts</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the best methods of buying a </span><b>used 4 wheel electric forklift</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is through </span><b>online auctions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Here on trademachines.com, you can see a huge number of four wheel electric forklifts </span><b>for sale </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">which are auctioned by our partnering auction houses. Similarly, you can also sell your used 4 wheel forklifts through the auction houses if you are planning to buy a new one or if you have decided to go for some other kind of forklift.

Two frontal prongs, or forks, are used to engage with loads mounted on pallets, which are specially designed to be raised by forklift trucks.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Front Loaded Forklifts And Their Main Manufacturers</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Initially developed from the hoists that were used in the 1880s, forklifts came into more widespread use during the First World War, when a shortage of manpower gave rise to a need for machines designed to lift and carry. Front loaded forklifts, as the name implies, have the fork attachments situated at the front of the vehicle on a mast operated by hydraulic cylinders and interlocking rails. Forklifts are generally counterbalanced to offset the weight of the load, and may be powered by electric battery, propane, diesel or petrol. If you are looking to buy a front loaded forklift, then JCB have a strong reputation as a leading manufacturer of reliable and easy to use forklifts. The JUNGHEINRICH range of electric counterbalance front loaded forklifts are renowned for being smooth to operate and robust. TOYOTA remain the most popular and best selling manufacturer of this equipment. However, CROWN have remained consistently in the top ten best selling list for many years. The Grendia range offered by MITSUBISHI are noted for their low maintenance design and superior fuel economy. For heavy trucks the LINDE company are hard to beat.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Reasons To Buy Used Front Loaded Forklifts At Auction</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The advantages when you buy a used front loaded forklift at auction are considerable. Firstly, you incur less cost than you would when buying new. Secondly, when you buy used front loaded forklifts you avoid the rapid depreciation in value that you incur when buying new, and expensive, machinery. All of this is a big help when you are keeping a watchful eye on your bottom line. Lastly, front loaded forklifts are robust, so you may well find a bargain that will last you for years when you buy a used front loaded forklift at auction.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Manufacturers Of Front Loaded Forklifts</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">AGRIA, ALLIS-CHALMERS, AMEISE, AMLIFT, ATHEY, ATLET, AUSA, BAKER, BARRETT, BATTIONI &amp; PAGANI, BAUMANN, BENDI, BIG JOE, BOBCAT, BONSER, BOSS, BROUWER, BT, CANGARU, CARER, CASE, CATERPILLAR, CDS, CESAB, CHAMP, CHARIOT, CHARLATTE, CLARK, COMBILIFT, COMQUIP, CROWN, CVS FERRARI, CYCLONE, DAEWOO, DAHMER, DALIAN, DATSUN, DONKEY, DOOSAN, DRESSER, DREXEL, EAGLE PICHER, EAVES, ELWELL PARKER, EUROYEN, FANTUZZI, FENWICK, FLEXI, FORANO, FORD, GERLINGER, GLOBAL POWER, GREGORY, GROVE, HALLA, HAMECH, HANGCHA, HARLO, HC, HEDEN, HELI, HOIST, HUBTEX, HYSTER, HYUNDAI, INGERSOLL-RAND, INTERNATIONAL, IRION, JAC, JCB, JELCZ, JOHN DEERE, JUMBO, JUNGHEINRICH, KALMAR, KESMAC, KIPOR, KOMATSU, KONE, KOOI AAP, KUBOTA, LANCER BOSS, LANSING, LEES, LEWIS-SHEPARD, LIFT KING, LIFT MASTER, LIFT-ALL, LIFT-IT, LINDE, LION, LIUGONG, LOAD LIFTER, LOC, LUGLI, MANITOU, MARIOTTI, MASSEY-FERGUSON, MAST EXPLORER, MASTER CRAFT, MAXIMAL, MAXLIFT, MIAG, MIC, MICHIGAN, MILLER, MITSUBISHI, MOFFETT, MONTINI, MORA, NAMCO, NASCO, NAVIGATOR, NICHIYU, NISSAN, NOBLE, NYK, O &amp; K, OMEGA, OMG, OMNI, ORMIC, OWATONNA, PALETRANS, PALFINGER, PATRICK, PETTIBONE, PHILIFT, PRAT, PRIME-MOVER, PRINCETON, QINGDAO, RAYGO, RAYMOND, RICO, ROANOKE, ROCLA, ROL-LIFT, ROYAL, SAMAG, SANDERSON, SCATTRAK, SCHAEFF, SEEGRID, SELLICK, SEMAX, SHANGLI, SICHELSCHMIDT, SINOMACH, SISU, SMV, SPYDER, STANDEN, STARKLIFT, STEINBOCK, STILL, STONE, SUMITOMO, SVETRUCK, TAILIFT, TAYLOR, TAYLOR DUNN, TCI, TCM, TELEDYNE, TOVEL, TOYOTA, TUSK, UNIVERSAL, UROMAC, USTC, UTILEV, VALLEE, VALMET, VIKING, VIPER, VOLVO, WACO, WALDON, WECAN, WHITE, WIGGINS, WINDHAM, XIAJIN, XILIN, YALE, YORK, YTO</p> <h5 style=\"text-align: justify\"><a href=\"//trademachines.com/front-end-loader-manufacturers\">Here is the list of top front end loader manufacturers worldwide.</a></h5>"},{"id":"1247_en","content":"<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3 wheel electric forklift truck and its features</span></h2>\r\n<p><b>Electric forklifts are quiet and reliable</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and produce no emissions.

As technology allowed these trucks to be smaller, so it also allowed for the more efficient use of available space in the working environment. Today, for example, drive in racking is designed to have just enough room to allow the ingress and necessary manoeuvres of compact forklifts. MARIOTTI is a major name in the field of compact forklifts. The company's range of 3 wheel trucks with lift capacities ranging from 600 to 1300 kg are known for ease of service and for being low maintenance. They offer a choice of rear, front and all wheel drive options, all of which have electronic curve speed control. Despite boasting lift heights of up to 5.7 metres, these trucks are some of the most compact in their class. Another very popular compact forklift is the TOYOTA Trago 48 electric counterbalance. This has a reputation for versatility, has very user friendly controls and is available in 3 and 4 wheel configurations. The NISSAN Nomad is noted for its excellent fuel efficiency, tight handling and superior manoeuvrability in confined spaces. The on board diagnostics are reportedly first class. For those seeking to buy used compact forklifts with a heavy duty capacity, the HYSTER Fortens range of compact internal combustion engine forklift trucks are well regarded for their power, dependability and excellent all around visibility. They have an overall length of 4130 mm and are available in diesel or LPG variants. The YALE Veracitor VX series is designed specifically for heavy duty in confined areas. If a stand up used compact forklift is required, the CROWN RC 5500 series is ideal for applications where the operator is required to be frequently hopping on and off the truck. These 3 wheel compacts are fitted with the company's exclusive FlexRide operator suspension.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Why Buy Used Compact Forklifts At Auction?</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">There are distinct advantages to be gained when buying used compact forklifts at auction. New equipment can be very costly, so there are major savings to be enjoyed when you decide to buy used compact forklifts. Moreover, the rapid depreciation in value that is incurred when buying new is avoided. Used compact forklifts bought at auction are generally available immediately, so there's no waiting involved. Additionally, compact forklifts are robust enough to stand up to years of use. The previous owner may simply be looking to upgrade or may have altered the focus of his business, so the chances are that at a used compact forklift auction you will be buying a well maintained piece of equipment that will last you for many years to come.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">The Major Manufacturers Of Compact Forklifts</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Not all forklift truck manufacturers produce compact versions.

Forklift trucks are an excellent example of niche vehicle success for natural gas. Natural gas powered forklifts offer convenience and safety unmatched by any other forklift fuels, including battery electric systems. Refuelling can be done very quickly in less than 5 minutes, without the inconvenience or dangers of swapping over heavy LPG bottles. Emissions from a natural gas forklift trucks are considerably lesser than petrol, diesel or LPG forklifts and they are also up to 50% quieter, ensuring safer working environments for the workers. CNG forklifts provide the same heavy duty power as LPG forklifts. Natural gas burns cleaner than gasoline or diesel, which means less wear and tear on engine parts. Natural gas forklifts do not require the battery maintenance of electric forklifts, which can lead to extensive downtime and increased space for charging and storage.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">TOYOTA and Natural Gas Forklifts</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Tasmanian natural gas distributor, Tas Gas Networks joined hands with TOYOTA Material Handling's Tasmanian dealer FRM TOYOTA a few years back to offer compressed natural gas (CNG) for forklift trucks. Some of the reasons behind this collaboration were the significant cost savings that can be reaped from the usage of natural gas as a fuel for forklifts and the lower emissions of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) than other fossil fuels. Initially, four CNG powered vehicles were introduced in Tasmania including a TOYOTA 8FG25 forklift. Also in February 2005, TOYOTA Material Handling, U.S.A. (TMHU) began offering compressed natural gas as a fuel system option for a number of its forklift models.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Where to find Used Natural Gas Forklifts?</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">When safety is of utmost concern, factories decide to change their present fleet of forklift trucks powered by other fuels like diesel, petrol etc. into natural gas powered forklifts. Initially, rather than buying new natural gas forklift trucks, companies opt to buy used natural gas forklifts as there will not be a major deviation in quality of the used natural gas forklifts. <strong>Used natural gas forklifts for sale</strong> can be easily found on websites where online auctions take place, like TradeMachines.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Natural Gas Forklift Manufacturers</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Few of the highly established manufacturers of forklifts who offer compressed natural gas also as a fuel option in their forklift models are: TOYOTA, NISSAN, MANITOU, HOIST, NYK, HYNDAI, CROWN, MITSUBISHI, LINDE, Doosan, Wisconsin, JUNGHEINRICH, CLARKE, YALE, KOMATSU, HUBTEX, CATERPILLAR and RAYMOND.</p>"},{"id":"1254_en","content":"<p><strong>Warehouse machinery</strong> is used to expedite the storage and movement of goods within a warehouse environment.

There is a number of differences between those two types. </span><b>High reach forklift trucks</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are almost exclusively used in situations where high racking is arrayed in relatively narrow \"corridors\". As a result, your average </span><b>high-reach truck</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> will take up less floor space than its counterbalanced cousins. This is achieved by having two \"legs\" protrude from the front of the forklift in order to stop it tipping forward, as opposed to counterbalanced forklifts which simply have a large weight on the back of the forklift, taking up valuable space.</span></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33503 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/high-reach-forklift-in-a-warehouse-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"high reach forklift in a warehouse\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike in an ordinary forklift, high reach forklift’s operator stands on the platform and is being lifted together with the forks.

They can be used for scheduled public transport, scheduled school transport, for tourism or for private hire.</p> <h2>Buses And Their Leading Manufacturers</h2> <p>The earliest buses were the horse drawn versions of the 1820s, followed by steam models a short time later. Electric trolleybuses came on the scene in the 1880s, and the first commercial buses powered by the internal combustion engine appeared in the mid 1890s. DAIMLER were one of the first companies to become successful in the field of bus manufacturing. In more recent years there has been increased interest in more environmentally friendly buses, leading to electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, bio diesel and compressed natural gas fuel options. The most common design in the world today is the single deck rigid bus, with minibuses for applications serving fewer passengers, and double decker and articulated buses used to transport greater numbers. The VOLVO B7R is a coach chassis that is available with a range of bodies. Used around the world, it has a reputation for robustness and reliability. The VOLVO Olympian and Super Olympian are rear engined double decker buses that also have a world class reputation and are very popular among those looking to buy used buses. ALEXANDER DENNIS are a world-renowned bus manufacturing company whose products are noted for supremely high quality. The ALEXANDER DENNIS Enviro range is noted for excellent style and fuel economy, along with enhanced passenger comfort and greatly reduced tailpipe emissions. The MAN CitySmart is noted for its superb performance on urban routes, being both versatile and reliable, and has a capacity of 37 seated and 32 standing. The SCANIA ADL 300 has a 12 metre overall length and are available as the diesel-powered E300S and the compressed natural gas or bio-gas fuelled E300SG, the latter being classified as carbon neutral when using sustainable fuel. The various fully built buses manufactured by TATA are noted for excellence and very high quality standards. They are particularly in demand as used buses at auction. The BLUE BIRD company specialise in school buses and their line of vehicles is noted for innovative design, safety and reliability.</p> <h2>What Are The Advantages Of Buying Used Buses At Auction?</h2> <p>Perhaps the most common reason for buying used buses is to save money on initial costs. You can pick up a vehicle at a used buses auction for a far lower price than if you were to buy new. In some cases, the bus might not be required every day or be needed for travelling very far, so it's not essential to have a brand new model and you will still get value for money. Another advantage if you choose to buy used buses is avoiding a loss due to depreciation as new buses, as with most other vehicles, lose value as soon as they are driven away.</p> <h2>Manufacturers Of Buses</h2> <p>Some of the most popular and sought after bus models are manufactured by companies such as ALEXANDER DENNIS, ASHOK LEYLAND, BLUE BIRD, EVOBUS, IKARUS, MERCEDES-BENZ, MAN, NEOPLAN, SCANIA, SETRA, TATA and VOLVO. There is also a number of smaller or more specialised and regional companies.</p>"},{"id":"1284_en","content":""},{"id":"1280_en","content":"<p><strong>Vans</strong> are enclosed vehicles that are generally used for transporting people or goods.

When this first caught on large motorcycle companies such as HONDA began to enter the field. The first of HONDA ATVs to be produced was the HONDA US90, and as was customary throughout most of the 70s it had large, soft tyres rather than a mechanical suspension. The latter was introduced in the early 80s, again by HONDA, who enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the <strong>all-terrain  vehicle solutions</strong> at the time. The HONDA ATC200X appeared in 1983 and was, with front and rear disc brakes and full suspension, the best all terrain vehicle for sale at that time. This <strong>ATV for sale</strong> is still in plentiful supply and much sought after by those looking to buy<strong> used all-terrain vehicles</strong>. SUZUKI was a frontrunner in the development of 4 wheel all-terrain vehicles, beginning with the SUZUKI QuadRunner LT125 in 1982. The first high performance four-wheeled all-terrain vehicle was the SUZUKI LT250R QuadRacer, a machine exclusively designed for racing and still popular on the<strong> used all-terrain vehicle market</strong>. Also much in demand is the CAN-AM Renegade 500. This has great strength and durability while still being surprisingly light and, with its low centre of gravity, offers a smooth and comfortable ride. The POLARIS Ranger series of all-terrain vehicles is highly regarded for its tough, reliable construction and ease of use. The LANDFIGHTER Conquistador 6.6 is well regarded for its precise handling, comfort and rapid acceleration capability. In the field of utility and 6 wheel all-terrain vehicles the ARGO 6X6 Frontier 580 is much in demand. This is a six wheel drive amphibious off-road vehicle that can transport four passengers on land and two on water. The TGB Landmaster 550 EFI / EPS 4X4 is noted as a great workhorse for applications in which load carrying in a challenging environment is required. The cargo bed has a gas assisted tipping system.</p> <h3>The Advantages of Buying Used All-Terrain Vehicles</h3> <p>New <strong>all-terrain vehicles for sale</strong> can prove costly, so an appealing alternative option is to buy used all terrain vehicles. Used<strong> all-terrain vehicles prices</strong> are considerably lower than those we see in showrooms. An excellent way of checking out what is available is by way of used <strong>all-terrain vehicle auctions</strong>, where you can get to see, and choose from different types of all-terrain vehicles. Furthermore, ATVs on sale tend to be very durable and robust by nature. The number of vehicles manufactured back in the 80s that are still running demonstrates this.

Motorcycle designs vary according to purpose, from cruisers to sport models to off road.</p> <h2>Motorcycles And The Leading Manufacturers</h2> <p>The history of the motorcycle goes all the way back to the 1860s when steam powered bicycles were produced. The first motorised bicycle was invented by Edward Butler in 1884, but was not a success. Many claim that the DAIMLER Reitwagen of 1885 was the first true motorcycle, but this was simply an experimental vehicle rather than a production model. The first motorcycle to actually go into commercial production was the 1894 HILDEBRAND &amp; WOLFMULLER and this caught on to the extent that by the turn of the century there were a number of companies producing this new form of transport. Demand during the First World War accelerated production. Today the industry is dominated by Japanese companies, but smaller, more specialised manufacturers can still thrive. One of the most popular motorcycles around, and one that is proving hot on the used motorcycle market is the KAWASAKI Ninja 1000. This crossover sport bike is really fast but also has enough of a laid back temperament to appeal to the everyday rider. It has a three mode traction control. The YAMAHA SR400 is a cult classic with a distinct 1970s styling. It's economical and has a straightforward, air-cooled, single cylinder motor. In the world of adventure motorcycles, the SUZUKI V-Strom 650 ABS offers a comfortable riding position for long hauls, and of course it has ABS, so is a lot safer when the weather gets wet. On the minibike front the HONDA Grom is a 125-cc compact that is a great alternative to the traditional scooter. In the cruiser category the TRIUMPH Rocket III Roadster is a cool and comfortable front runner that is proving to be in demand from riders looking to buy used motorcycles. Highly regarded among off road enthusiasts is the BMW HP2 Enduro; a great looking machine with serious rough terrain potential, and the first off road motorcycle that the company made for the general public.</p> <h2>What Are The Advantages Of Buying Used Motorcycles At Auction?</h2> <p>The major drawback to buying used motorcycles is financial. New motorcycles suffer from a marked depreciation in value the moment they are driven away from the dealer. Buying used motorcycles is a way of letting the original owner take that financial hit while you save money. If you are looking to buy used motorcycles you will find that you can get the model you are looking for that much cheaper. This approach can even place a higher grade, and therefore more expensive, model well within your price range.

Hollow profiles, like pipes, have the risk associated with them that they can buckle. A kink in a pipe will ruin the workpiece as it cannot be repaired. A <strong>profile bending machine</strong> contains a clever mechanical system that prevents this from happening and to produce precise radii. There are several different types of profile <strong>metal bending equipment</strong>. <strong>Mandrel bending machines</strong> are used for thin-walled pipes with a diameter of only a few centimetres. These machines are made out of a mandrel, a bending tool, a bending head and a counter bearing. During mandrel bending, the profile to be bent is pushed over the mandrel and fixed between the bending tool and the clamp. The mechanic or hydraulically operated bending head turns along the bending axis and thereby, shapes the workpiece.

The more brittle the material, the thinner the walls and the smaller the bending radius, the more demanding the bending process will be. The mandrel bending process is most suited to produce high-quality small bending radii. Hardened case-hardened steel is the only material that the bending tool can be made out of. The addition hardening stage is necessary, to guarantee that the working-life of the tool is long enough. The tool can compress or buckle if not hardened, which leads to the formation of creases. During the bending process, these creases have a formative impact on the workpiece, which would render it useless. In addition to using hardened steel, the build up of creases can be prevented by using a crease smoother or by pre-heating the profile. A different tool has to be produced for all areas of application, and therefore mandrel bending is most suited for the production of series and standard components.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_26620\" style=\"width: 382px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-26620\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/Euromac-profile-banding-machine.jpg\" alt=\"Euromac profile banding machine\" width=\"382\" height=\"420\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Euromac profile banding machine</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Pyramid bending rollers</strong> are particularly suited for the individual production of profile radii. They are generally made out of <strong>three rollers</strong> that are driven towards one another. The desired bend in the profile produced depends on the size of the outer rollers and the depth of the middle roller. The rollers turn and can produce complex bent pipe workpieces. Pyramid bending rollers are commonly used by automobile workshops and plumbers to produce individual profiles like pipes and exhaust pipes. The pyramid bending rollers are available as complete <a href=\"//trademachines.com/bearbeitungszentren\"><strong>machining centres</strong></a>, which can produce complex pipe and profile in the desired quantity. The company <strong>BILGER</strong> has a particularly cheap and flexible <strong>profile bending machine for sale</strong>, which can be used for small companies, assembly work and entrepreneurs. It combines the flexibility of the pyramid bending rollers with the efficiency of the mandrel bending machine. The small bending machine called “Variobieger” can, with a choice of standard tools, be quickly built to suite the requirements of the operator.</p> <h3>Sizes and Types of Profile Bending Machines</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_10531\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-10531\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/PROFILE-BENDING-MACHINE-300x136.jpg\" alt=\"profile bender at work\" width=\"300\" height=\"136\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Profile bending with a mechanical bender</figcaption></figure> <p>The types of motors and operating systems for <strong>profile bending machines</strong> are designed depending on the demands of the profile. Small and medium sized pipes and rods can be produced using purely mechanical systems like levers, knuckle joint presses and spindles. These profiles are regularly produced depending based on visual judgement and this is usually sufficient for non-critical applications. Half-mechanical bending machines work with manually operated hydraulic motors. With the help of a hand pump, the operator can use the hydraulic system to apply a large amount of targeted force onto the profile. This process is most commonly used for assembly work. It allows the production of individual bends in the profile without requiring electricity. <strong>Automatic and fully hydraulic motors</strong> are used for<strong> metal bending machines</strong>. These are available for profiles of all sizes. Particularly large bending machines can be found alongside track and pipeline constructions. The necessary bends are produced on site by mobile stations.</p> <h3>Working with Profile Benders</h3> <p>Profiles are required in the context of a construction. They are an element made up of several components, are used to produce a pre-developed product. The<strong> i</strong>ndividual production of profiles requires the same skill set, which is found in the occupation profile of those who finish products. The individual production of profiled pieces can also be learned by talented, but otherwise unskilled, workers. The bending of profiles is relatively safe. However, a safety briefing before using a profile bending machine is useful. Mass produced components are fully automatically produced on profile bending machines such as aluminium profile bending machine or upvc profile bending machine. Just like every other production machine, the only tasks required are loading and unloading. Additionally, these products require regular quality control. In order to not have to teach skilled workers how to handle the tools, it is recommended to prepare templates that during the quality control of profiles. The wear and tear on bending tool is minimal. However, the <strong>high amount of force</strong>, which is required to correctly bend profiles, can drastically affect the counter bearings of the machine. These are usually designed to be adjustable. Strict quality control measures can identify the need for adjustment early enough to prevent wasting products and the requirement for post-production.</p> <p></p> <h3>Profile Bending Machines Manufacturers</h3> <p><strong> BILGER</strong>, <strong>GRANGIER</strong> <strong>CONSTRUCTEUR</strong>, <strong>O+P</strong>, and <strong>NUOVA</strong> produce good products for workshops and assembly work.

This is the case for components of a clock mechanism and the lower construction of machines and devices. The <strong>production of construction elements</strong> contains <strong>two processes</strong>: <strong>casting an entire component; and joining together series components. </strong>When casting components, in order to reach the required precision it is necessary to undertake post-production metal cutting processes. Straightening or welding cast parts is not possible. <strong>Cast components </strong>are generally monolithic and because of their course, crystallised internal structure. Thereby, <strong>no subsequent bending processes </strong>are used for these products.</p> <p lang=\"en-US\">Due to the post-processing stage, rolled and drawn components have a relatively finer internal crystal structure. This means that these components can be thoroughly processed through bending, pressing and straightening.</p> <p lang=\"en-US\">A <strong>sheet metal straightening machine</strong> is necessary for several reasons. Products manufactured using thermal processes, like continually cast beams, welded components like steel pipes or welded steel profiles, can contain irregular internal tensions after they cool down. Stress pointsare weak points in a construction and can act as a breaking point. These are removed from a workpiece using heat treatment in a furnace. After the <strong>annealing process</strong>, the workpiece is no longer dimensionally stable but more or less strongly distorted. Straightening benches are used to re-establish the required stability within the workpiece. Another application for straightening machines is to repair cold warped construction like automobiles that have been in an accident. In addition to tubes and profiles, high-end straighteners be used to transform single sheet metal workpieces into smooth and straight components. Bars and shafts are brought into a precisely straight form using special roll straightening machines.</p> <p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Straightening is really important during the production of bent mass series products. </strong>For example, galvanised steel angles need to be shaped into the 90° angle before the galvanising process. Zinc is too brittle and cannot be bent afterwards. Ripping open the zinc layer can result in losing the protective layer against corrosion. Undesired warpage can occur during galvanization (particularly zinc and chrome plating) because it is a heat treatment. However, <strong>straightening machines can be used</strong> to lightly re-bend a galvanised component</p> <h2>The structure and function of a straightening machine</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_7602\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7602 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/sm-3-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"straightener-in-use\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hydraulic stamps are part of metal sheet straighteners</figcaption></figure> <p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Straighteners</strong> are used to bend targeted points on a bent construction so far, so that when they spring back, they are fall into the desired form. In order to achieve this, the single components need to be bent so far from one another that the reformation effect occurs at the desired point. <strong>A straightening bench uses stops, measurable points and hydraulic pressing cylinders. </strong>A sheet metal straightener works with particularly wide hydraulic stamps. <strong>High-end straightening machines support the straightening process with a supply of hot air. </strong></p> <p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Working with a straightener requires a high level of experience</strong>. Metal cannot often be bent beyond a certain point. With every bend, the bending point hardens, which can result in fatigue fractures. This is particularly relevant for cold damaged constructions like the bodies of automobiles after an accident. These can be visually and optically made stable again using straightening. However, <strong>the strength of the base structure will be lost through excessive straightening. </strong>This needs to be taken into consideration before undertaking the straightening process. In this instance, it is usually more common to replace the damaged frame.</p> <p lang=\"en-US\">A <strong>special process </strong>is <strong>roller straightening.</strong> Components that need to be very straight are usually finished on roll straightening machines. This includes components like shafts, full-floating axles and tools like drills. These are clamped into a lathe chuck and then straightened by two roller stamps, while being rotated. Upper and lower stamps continue to grip the rotating component until the lens system no longer registers any deflections. Nowadays, this process is supported by a computer and monitored by a camera. <strong>The qualities and levels of precision that can be achieved today were not possible before the introduction of the computer assisted straightening processes. </strong></p> <figure id=\"attachment_7599\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7599 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/sm-1-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"bar straightening machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bar straightening Machines are another type of straightening machines</figcaption></figure> <p lang=\"en-US\">Sheet metal straightening machines have several intermeshing rollers with numerous hydraulic stamps. They roll sheet metal through cold or hot processes, so that they can be fully taken from the machine again. Nowadays, these processes can be automatic. <strong>Metalworking facilities, particularly those that are used to produce welded constructions, can be made more efficient through the use of straightening machines. </strong> Within construction facilities, the quality of the delivered products is very important. Contrary to cut or wrongly cut products, straighteners on sale can be used to transform crooked and wavy products into ones that can be used again. If a metal straightener is applied before the construction process, an approximate quality can be produced that pre-products of other companies can be compared and swtiched with. This prevents the need for post-production straightening or interrupting workflows due to a component that does not fit correctly.</p> <h2>Suppliers of straighteners for sale</h2> <p lang=\"en-US\">Straightening benches that are used to straighten finished constructions are available from CELETTE, BLACKHAWK and DOZER.</p> <p lang=\"en-US\">Roll straightening machines, which are also called bar straightening machines, are used to straighten holes and shafts.

In the 70s metal laser cutters began to be used extensively in the aerospace industry for cutting titanium. CO2 lasers for cutting non-metals were being developed around the same time. <strong>Today the use of CNC laser cutters is widespread.</strong> Laser beams are generated by the stimulation of lasing material within a closed area by electrical discharges or lamps. The resultant beam is reflected until a certain energy level is reached, at which point it escapes as coherent light. This is focussed and directed by a lens onto the workpiece to a point of about 0.025 mm.

An Nd (neodymium) laser is used for boring where high energy coupled with low repetition is required. Nd-YAG (neodymium-yttrium-aluminium-garnet) lasers are used for boring and engraving requiring very high power. <strong>Laser cut machine</strong> types are generally available in three different configurations; moving material, hybrid and flying optics, referring to the way that the laser beam is moved in relation to the workpiece. Moving material lasers move the material under a stationary cutting head. Hybrid lasers move the workpiece along one axis while the cutting head moves along another axis. Flying optics lasers move over the workpiece while it remains stationary.</p>\r\n<h2>Buying Used Laser Cutting Machines For Sale</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Laser cutting machines</strong> tend to be very costly items of metalworking equipment.

They are mainly used where there is a requirement for processing large steel panels. These machines are, for example, used for special machine construction, specialising on particularly large machines. They are also used for ship construction, building rail vehicles or mining equipment.

The machine can weigh 60 tonnes or more. Just like other boring tools, they are also an open construction. That means that they do not have a cover. Therefore, the loading and unloading of workpieces is particularly easy. Floor type boring mills require a lot of space, and need a lot of energy for operation. They also require a separate foundation to be installed. This means that they are often one of the biggest and most sophisticated machine tools within a facility. A powerful lifting device and transportation vehicles are required when using a floor type boring mill. Their operation and maintenance should be reserved exclusively for specialised personnel. Just like all other cutting machine tools, they need to be regularly cleaned.</p>"},{"id":"1320_en","content":""},{"id":"1316_en","content":"<h3>Boring Mills And The Leading Brands And Manufacturers</h3>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8136\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8136 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/bm-1-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"horizontal boring mill\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boring mills expand previously drilled holes for higher accuracy</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<table class=\"alignright\" style=\"height: 416px;background-color: #ffffff\" border=\"1\" width=\"324\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"272\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong>TOYODA HB series Technical Specification</strong></span></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Table Size</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">56.7\" x 63\" (1,440 mm x 1,600 mm)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>X-axis Travel </strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">78.7\" (2,000 mm)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Y-axis Travel </strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">70.9\" (1,800 mm)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Z-axis Travel </strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">51.2\" (1,300 mm)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>W-axis Travel</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">19.7\" (500 mm)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Maximum Table Load</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">17,636 lb (8,000 kg)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Spindle Drive Motor </strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">35 HP (26 kW) for 30 min. / 30 HP (22 kW) cont.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Spindle Output Torque</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">876 ft-lb (1,188 Nm)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Spindle Taper</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">CAT50</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Standard Net Weight</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">79,200 lb (36,000 kg)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Boring is a <strong>machining process</strong> whereby the diameter of an existing hole is enlarged to <strong>achieve greater accuracy.</strong> Examples can be found in engine cylinder or gun barrel manufacturing. This process takes place using a boring mill. Boring milling machines can be divided into vertical and horizontal boring machines. With vertical boring mills, the workpiece <strong>rotates around</strong> a <strong>vertical axis.</strong> Horizontal boring mills have the <strong>workpiece fixed</strong> in place while the boring bar, the protruding arm of the machine that holds the cutting tool, rotates around a horizontal axis. Due to the amount of <strong>heat generated</strong> by <strong>this process</strong> in a restricted area, cooling of the bores is effected by <strong>running coolant through</strong> a hollowed out section of the boring bar. Deep hole boring is a very <strong>challenging task requiring special tooling</strong> and techniques, but technology has been developed that ensures an impressive level of accuracy. CNC boring mills help to <strong>make</strong> such <strong>accuracy possible.</strong> These enable the programming of predetermined boring cycles that move the tool through a fixed routine. The <strong>TOYODA HB</strong> series is well regarded as a resilient and tough line of horizontal boring mills for sale designed for heavy cutting applications. The FERMAT horizontal boring mills are very popular. The AWEA MB series of high precision boring mills have acquired a reputation for outstanding accuracy.

A typical jig boring machine consists of <strong>a heavy base and a column</strong>. At the top, the column carries the spindle which exhibits up &amp; down movement along the vertical guideways. Anti-friction bearings are installed to take care of the radial and axial loads to which the spindle is subjected to. The table mounted over the addle moves in various directions along the guideways present on the saddle. Longitudinal motion to the work is given by moving the table while cross movement is provided by moving the saddle. The vertical movement is by the upward and downward motion of the spindle.</p> <h3>Jig Boaring Measurement Systems &amp; Machines</h3> <p>Devices with stable and adjustable end gauges and indicator sensing units are used on jig-boring machines for precise and accurate measurements. The commonly used measurement systems in a jig boring machine are discussed below:</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9997\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9997\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/boring-jig.jpg\" alt=\"Jig Boring Table of SIP Machine\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Machining Table of a Jig Boring Machine</figcaption></figure> <ul> <li><strong>Precision Lead Screw system</strong>: This kind of measuring system which is provided underneath the table consists of a lead screw, a graduated micrometer dial, and a vernier at its end. The advantage of this system is the usage of compensators whose primary function is to correct and sometimes eliminate the errors in table movements. But the major limitation of this measurement device is that it is limited to only small tables.</li> <li><strong>End Measurement system</strong>: End measurements are carried out by accurately finished rods and end adjustments are performed with the help of micrometers. For correction, the end measures and the micrometer are placed between the dial indicator on one side and an adjustable stop on the other side of the table. The table is then moved until the dial indicator reads zero. As it is versatile and can be used on all sizes and lengths of tables, it more preferred over the precision lead screw system.</li> <li><strong>Scale and Microscope system</strong>: In this system, accurate graduated scales and a microscope are incorporated in the machine for accurate movement of the table. Measurements are performed accurately by the microscope. As there is no usage of wearing parts, the system is highly accurate.</li> <li><strong>Electromagnetic system</strong>: The system consists of two equispaced bars carrying electromagnetic projections. A precision micrometer fitted just below the table is fastened to a magnetic head for zero reading. When the magnetic centre of a projection is just in front of the head, the meter reads zero. It can be termed as a quick adjusting system as it ensures rapid traverse of the table and the saddle.</li> </ul> <h4>Types of Jig Boring Machines</h4> <figure id=\"attachment_10000\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10000\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/vertical-jig-boring-machine.jpg\" alt=\"HAUSER Jig Boring Machine\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Vertical Jig Boring Machine for small parts</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Vertical jig boring machines</strong> are the extensively used machines for boring, reaming, counter sinking of holes in jigs, dies, fixtures and other similar tools. It can also be used for carrying out <strong>light milling operations</strong> as well. A precision jig boring machine consists of an inclined rotary table in addition to a plain rotary table. The size of the boring machine is generally specified by the <strong>diameter of the spindle</strong> but in the case of vertical boring machines, the dimensions of the column height and table size should also be mentioned. Similarly, Horizontal boring jig comes into play in horizontal boring and milling processes.</p> <h3 class=\"category\">Jig Machine is Useful</h3> <p>One of the prominent advantages of jig boring machines is that it can maintain <strong>accuracy between multiple holes</strong> and surfaces. With the help of the aforementioned measurement systems, positioning of upto 0.003 mm can be achieved directly from the drawing in a typical jig machine. Tolerances can also be held tightly within 0.005 mm. When designing a part with holes, it is important to determine <strong>what holes must be jig bored</strong>. The reason behind this is that jig boring operation requires extra time and attention, and the <strong>jig boring machine</strong> at the machine shop may have a back log of jobs. Jig boring thus has a big impact on the lead time of a part. Ultimately, jig boring machines are characterized by less productivity because of high cycle time but it is <strong>greatly compensated by the accuracy</strong> provided by the machine. Also to prevent the influence of ambient temperature changes on accurate machining, the temperature is constantly maintained at 20◦ C by installing the jig machines in<strong> insulated areas</strong> with special environmental enclosures.</p> <p>Few <strong>jig boring machine manufacturers</strong> in the world are: MAG, YASDA, Kitamura Machinery, SIP, MITSUI SEIKI, Willemin-Macodel and SHE HONG.</p> <p></p>"},{"id":"1322_en","content":"<h2>Metal CNC Lathe</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_26443\" style=\"width: 356px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-26443\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/DMG-MORI-NEF-400-CNC-Lathe.jpg\" alt=\"DMG MORI NEF 400 CNC Lathe\" width=\"356\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">DMG MORI NEF 400 CNC Lathe</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p><strong>During the industrialisation turning (especially that of metal) was very important </strong>for e.g. the production of the steam engine and its associated components.

At its core, all the CNC lathe parts are available and a frame holds together the whole structure. It has to be stable enough to be able to carry the heavy weight of the components - as well as the CNC lathe accessories - and control the vibrations. The materials used are either cast metal or welded pieces. Depending on the size of the lathe, an additional cement foundation could be necessary. The lathe’s bed is what hosts all of the moveable components of the lathe. It is either made out of cast metal or a metal block. <strong>The feed is electrically, mechanically or hydraulically operated and it moves the workpiece carriage, which is secured by clamps.</strong> A bezel is used to ensure that very long workpieces are stable. The headstock and tailstock are used to clamp in the workpiece. The structure of a CNC lathe machine is more advanced, with a tool carriage and automatic steering. This means that the turning process is controlled through a programme. CNC lathe programming can either be determined by the machine itself, or written externally and transferred to the lathe through an interface.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7710\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7710 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/cncl-2-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"control panel cnc lathe\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Control panel of a CNC Lathe</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h2>Buying Used CNC Lathes For Sale</h2>\r\n<p>TradeMachines.com serves as a one stop location for buying used machine tools in industrial second hand market and auctions.

Both single and multiple spindle automatic lathes are categorized as centre type, chucking type, turret and special purpose lathes.</p> <h3><strong>Chucks and their Classification</strong></h3> <p>Automatic lathes specialized in chucking work are sometimes simply called as Chuckers. <strong>An automatic chucking lathe is designed primarily for machining large sized work pieces such as bigger castings and forgings which should be mounted on a chuck.</strong> A chuck is a device attached to the work spindle that holds the work piece by means of gripping it with jaws or fingers. The chucks can be basically classified into two types as: independent jaw chucks and universal chucks. An independent jaw chuck is one in which each of the jaws are adjusted with a screw action independently of the other jaws. On the contrary, in a universal chuck, jaws are arranged in such a way that they are all moved together at the same rate by a special wrench. It is also referred to as a self-centering chuck or concentric chuck. Collet chuck, face plate chuck, pin chuck, screw chuck, vacuum chuck, cup chuck are some of the other types of chucks.</p> <h3><strong>Application of Automatic Lathes</strong></h3> <p>The general purpose single spindle automatic lathes are widely used for mass production of high quality fasteners; bolts, screws, studs etc., bushings, pins, shafts, rollers, handles and similar small metallic parts from long bars or tubes of regular section and also often from separate small blanks. They are more preferred for high volume production runs. <strong>Multi spindle automatic lathes having four to eight parallel spindles are used when a much higher rate of production is required. </strong></p> <p></p>"},{"id":"1319_en","content":"<p><strong>A table type boring mill belongs to the cutting machine tool family.</strong> It is used to undertake milling and drilling processes on panels and metal blocks.

They have a low worktable, which can be hydraulically moved along three axes. The spindle is located on a vertical column. On high-end table type boring machines, the spindle can also move several centimetres along the z axis. The main movements are undertaken by the work table. The panel or block workpiece is placed onto the work table and then attached using clamps. <strong>All types of processes that have to do with drilling and milling can be undertaken on this machine.</strong> Boring mills horizontal table type are also available with a tool changer. The milling or drilling tool is often manually switched.</p> <p>Cooling lubricant is very important for these machines. Otherwise, the milling tool and components would very quickly become damaged. Additionally, the wear and tear on the hard metal tips or the switching plates is particularly high when not using a coolant.</p> <h2>Where are table type boring mills used?</h2> <p>A table type horizontal boring machine is mainly used for the production of machines and special machines. Table boring mills can mill complex structures out of monolithic blocks. This means that they are, for example,<strong> very well suited for building base frames and machine beds.</strong> These are usually made out of cast material.

Metal housings for a variety of appliances and equipment are mostly die cast. Some of the common die cast parts include propellers, gears, bushings, pumps, valves, pistons, cylinder heads, and engine blocks. </p> <h3>Process of Die Casting Machines</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_7537\" style=\"width: 287px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-7537\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/dcm-2-300x157.jpg\" alt=\"plunger for injection\" width=\"287\" height=\"150\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inject the molten metal with high pressure</figcaption></figure> <p>The die casting process is composed of <strong>five major stages</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Clamping</strong> – The first and foremost step is the preparation and clamping of the die unit. It is composed of two die halves which are attached to platens on the die cast machine. One of the halves is called as the cover die which is mounted on a stationary platen while the other half named as the ejector die is fixed on the movable platen. Each half is cleaned and lubricated well prior to the process and sufficient pressure is to be applied to keep both of them intact.</p> <p><strong>Injection</strong> - The molten metal, which is maintained at a particular temperature in the furnace, is then transferred into a chamber where it is injected into the closed die cavity. Injection time is always kept very low in order to prevent early solidification of any part of the metal.</p> <p><strong>Cooling</strong> – As soon as the molten metal is injected into the die cavity, it will start cooling and get solidified. The die unit should not be opened until sufficient cooling time is permitted and the casting is completely solidified. The thumb rule is that when the casting is required to have greater wall thickness, the amount of cooling time is more.</p> <p><strong>Ejection</strong> – After predetermined amount of cooling time, the casting is pushed out of the die cavity with the help of an ejection mechanism.</p> <p><strong>Trimming</strong> – The unwanted excess material called as the flash which has solidified along with the casting, must be trimmed off either manually by cutting or sawing, or with the help of a trimming press. </p> <h3>Types of Die Casting Machines</h3> <p>There are two principle types of die casting machines predominantly used in the industrial environment. They are: </p> <figure id=\"attachment_7541\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7541\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/dcm-3-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"Holding pot\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Holding pot pours molten aluminium into chamber</figcaption></figure> <ul> <li>Hot chamber type</li> <li>Cold chamber type </li> </ul> <p>The hot chamber type is used for the lower melting temperature alloys like zinc, tin and lead while the cold chamber machine is used primarily for the other alloys owing to their higher melting temperatures such as aluminium, brass and magnesium.<strong> In both the machines, the metal is contained in an open holding pot which is placed into a furnace, where it is melted to the necessary temperature.</strong> In hot chamber machines, the molten metal then flows into a shot chamber through an inlet and a plunger, powered by hydraulic pressure which typically ranges from 1000 psi to 5000 psi, thereby forcing the molten metal through a gooseneck channel eventually into the die. However in the case of cold chamber type machines, holding pot is kept separate from the die casting machine and the molten metal is ladled from the pot for each casting, rather than being pumped. The injection unit in a cold chamber machine is almost similar to that of the one in the hot chamber machine except that it does not comprise of a gooseneck channel. The injection pressure required in cold chamber process is comparatively quite high varying from 2000 psi to 20000 psi. Die casting machines are usually rated by clamping force capacity. The clamping systems can use either hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical, or a combination of any of these systems. Sometimes, this type of <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/metal\">metalworking machinery</a> </strong>are rated by the shot weight capacity of the injection system as well. </p> <figure id=\"attachment_26436\" style=\"width: 520px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-26436\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/TOSHIBA-Die-Casting-Machine.jpg\" alt=\"TOSHIBA Die Casting Machine\" width=\"520\" height=\"399\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TOSHIBA Die Casting Machine</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>High pressure die casting machines are used to force molten metal under high pressure into a mould formed from a pair of hardened steel dies.</strong> The advantages of this process are a high degree of dimensional accuracy, thereby reducing or even completely eliminating any necessity for secondary machining; the smoothness of the cast surfaces; a rapid rate of production; the ability to cast thinner walls and include inserts; and the high tensile strength that results in the finished product. </p> <p><strong>Hot chamber die casting machines use a reservoir of molten metal which is forced into the die by means of a pneumatic or hydraulic piston.</strong> This method results in fast cycle times, but it can only be used with metals that have low melting points. It cannot be used with aluminium. For this metal cold chamber die casting equipment such as aluminium die casting machines are used. Here the metal is melted in a furnace that is separate from the machine and then fed into the machine's injection cylinder or shot chamber. From here it is forced into the die by means of a pneumatic or hydraulic piston.</p> <h2>Buying Used Die Casting Machines </h2> <figure id=\"attachment_7535\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7535 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/dcm-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"die casting machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Die casting machines are rated by clamping force capacity</figcaption></figure> <p>Due to these <strong>considerable advantages</strong> there is a very healthy market for <strong>used die casting machines</strong>, which can easily be picked up at used industrial equipment second hand market. Die casting machines fall into two types; hot chamber or cold chamber, and are rated by their clamping force, which in most cases is between 2,500 and 25,000 kilograms, something that is well worth bearing in mind if you're looking for used die casting machines for sale. The die casting machine manufactures make them with heavy duty use in mind, they create them to last and with low maintains operating. When you will buy the used die casting machine you will know that the machine will still be fully operational. Big companies and factories change these machine often, so you might buy a used casting machine that probably haven't been in use for long time. </p>  <h3>Die Casting Machine Manufacturers</h3> <p>Though it has several notable advantages, it is a slightly expensive process because of the high tooling costs. Only certain alloys can be cast using this process. It is not viable to produce certain type of alloyed castings. Size and volume restrictions on castings that can be die casted also prevails.

The vice contains <strong>two clamping jaws</strong>, one of which is mobile. However, with some special designs, both can be mobile. They move together with a threaded spindle, whose threads have a trapezoidal profile. This reduces friction, which can often occur when using V-shaped threads e.g. for fastening bolts. When using them on machine tools, vices usually have a range of clamping possibilities such as slotted holes, longitudinal or cross grooves, or dovetail mounts. They also contain a base plate with a large surface area that can provide a reliable plane, which is parallel to the work table.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9217\" style=\"width: 315px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-9217\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/mv-3-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"milling machine vice\" width=\"315\" height=\"173\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Machine vice for the milling process</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Machine vices are significantly flatter than those used for handiwork production</strong>. Machine vices have a square or hexagonal bar instead of a fixed crank, used to drive the threaded spindle. This, depending on its position, protrudes into the workspace. A quick adjustment mechanism for the clamping jaw is a common feature of a machine vice, and it significantly reduces the clamping time. For the interchangeability of machine vices and their usability on different machine tools, the DIN 6370 specifies the dimensions of the connections, clamping jaw ranges and the configuration of the clamping jaws with tolerable variations.</p> <h3>Areas of Application and Examples of Machine Vices</h3> <p>Machine vices are used on different kinds of machine tools that undertake various processes. The amount of stress inflicted upon the vice during the processing of a workpiece can vary greatly. During conventional milling processes, the force fed from the tool into the workpiece lifts the workpiece off the surface. This force has to be absorbed by the vice. However, if these are milled in unison, then the components of the workpiece will press against the surface. Helical milling cutters produce another type of force, which acts at an angle against the direction of the feed.</p> <p>The power required for drilling, as well as sinking and reaming, is much more complex. First of all, the power of the feed moves in the direction of the tool's axis. When using a common workshop drilling machine with a vertical spindle, the workpiece is pressed against the table. Through its rotational movement, the tool additionally guides torque into the workpiece using a spiral-formed cut. When drilling workpieces with rotational symmetry, this torque moves in the direction of the workpiece axis, solely as a result of the frictional force between the clamping jaw and the workpiece. The coiled shaped cut created by the drill produces a level of power that works against that of the feed.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9218\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-9218\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/mv-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Manual machine vice\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Manual machine vice in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <p>This is most relevant for through boring, which is when the drill breaks through the surface of the workpiece’s far side and the pressure of the feed dissipates. Force against the feed direction can occur when material residue within the drilled hole’s diameter has not yet been processed. <strong>This needs to be noted when attaching the vice onto the machine tool.</strong></p> <p>There are <strong>two basic forms of machine vices</strong> available for universal use. When using simple machines vices with counter pressure, the threaded spindle pushes a moveable clamping jaw against another. These are fixed to one another with a base plate. This creates a C formed power flow, which means the base plate ends up bending. This stress does not impact a machine vice under tensile stress, which ensures that it remains flat. In this situation, the moveable jaw is a U shape, and is pulled towards the fixed jaw using a spindle, which is located between the two axes of the mobile components.</p> <p>Workpieces with rotational symmetry can be clamped into special types of machine vices and then centred. These special forms of vices contain two mobile clamping jaws. Both sit on the same spindle. One is controlled with the left-handed thread and the other with the right-handed thread. The jaws are synchronised in their movements, but also move against each other and always stay centred in relation to the base plate. They contain wedge shaped bearing areas, which means a workpiece with a cylindrical cross section can be vertically centred.</p> <p>There is another special type of machine vice, which is used for grinding processes. This vice can move horizontally and vertically. It is mounted on a support plate that is attached onto the grinding machine. The mobile clamping jaw contains a slanted surface area, which guides the component in the direction of the base plate when it is clamped in. This also prevents the workpiece being lifted by the tool.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9216\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-9216\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/mv-2-300x164.jpg\" alt=\"Automatic machine vice\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Automatic machine vice in a processing centre</figcaption></figure> <p>Vices for automatic machine tools, like processing centres, <strong>are suited for a high level of repeated accuracy and exactitude</strong>. This means that their base and front sides are ground and they have fixing holes. The adjustable clamping jaw contains elements to ensure exact positioning. High-end machine vices are also produced using complex mechanic-hydraulic motors. The vice has a mechanical motor, which is replaced by a hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical power generation over a threaded spindle. Due to the fact that the threaded spindle operates differently, this is not a vice in the original sense. However, the term “vice” is also used to describe this clamping device, because it undertakes the same task and only differs in terms of how the clamping power is generated.</p> <h2>Buy Used Machine Vices for Sale </h2> <p>If you are looking for a <strong>milling vice for sale</strong> anywhere in the world, TradeMachines will be able to supply the machinery that you require. <strong>Machine vices</strong> are a vital part of many manufacturing processes, from furniture production to metal working and plastics manufacturing, and we feature milling vice auctions that can deal with a huge range of industrial situations.

There are many reasons for the size of that unbalance, for example the procedures used for machining or assembly. When a rotating body is revolving in its bearings the unbalances cause dynamic forces and noise. Hazards for persons, machines and the environment may occur. Therefore balancing is a must for modern machines running at high speeds and requiring high precision. Balancing process means to reduce the amount of unbalance.<strong> For balancing it is checked whether the mass axis of a rotor is displaced from its rotational axis and how distant that is</strong>. If necessary – the mass distribution of a rotating body is being changed by balancing. As a result the forces and vibrations caused by the unbalance stay within permissible limits. In order to establish and maintain proper tension in a machine, a mechanic often needs the help of a specialized tool. A balancing machine, or balance machine, is used to help create this type of symmetry within rotating machines. It can perform this task through individual part rotation and sensor detection. </p> <figure id=\"attachment_9500\" style=\"width: 233px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-9500\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/bm-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Balancing machine\" width=\"233\" height=\"155\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Balancing machine in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <h2>The balancing machine and its principle</h2> <p>In a typical balancing machine for sale, a set of two firm pedestals are accompanied by bearings and a suspension. <strong>Most machines have the capability to balance a variety of parts.</strong> These parts can include rotors for electric motors, disc drives, turbines, disc brakes, fans, pumps, and propellers. To use a balancing machine, the item requiring alignment may be placed directly onto the bearings, either manually or mechanically. The unit is then rotated, using an air-, end-, or belt-drive. During the rotation, the item will vibrate. This vibration will enable the attached sensors within the machine to determine how unbalanced the unit may be, and therefore how much shift is needed to establish equilibrium. It can also pinpoint where weights are needed, if any, for balancing, and where the weights should be placed. </p> <h2>Uses of Balancing Machines </h2> <p>Balancing machines are used to:</p> <ul> <li>To <strong>minimize vibrations, noise etc</strong>. which in turn improves the machine life and reduces operator fatigue</li> <li>To <strong>minimize the dynamic stressing and fatigue</strong>, which leads to reduce sizes of machine elements &amp; foundations necessary</li> <li>To <strong>reduce power losses</strong>, as vibrating systems absorb energy due to the damping factor present in the system</li> <li>To <strong>avoid inaccuracy &amp; improper functioning</strong> of adjacent machinery due to transmission of vibrations</li> </ul> <figure id=\"attachment_9504\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-9504\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/bm-2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"mechanical balancing machine \" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Balance workpieces with a mechanical balancing machine</figcaption></figure> <h2>Classification of Balancing Machines </h2> <p>There are two main types of balancing machines based on the measurement principle which differ in their suspensions and not in the bearings:</p> <h3>Soft-bearing balancing machine </h3> <p>A soft-bearing balancing machine does balancing at a higher speed than the resonance frequency. A soft-bearing machine is thus near from a high-speed balancing machine. Soft-balancing machines are better for high-volume production, as they need to be calibrated for each different part being balanced. </p> <h3>Hard-bearing balancing machine </h3> <p>In a hard-bearing machine, balancing is done at a frequency lower than the resonance frequency of the suspension. A hard-bearing machine is generally more versatile and can handle pieces with greatly varying weights, because hard-bearing machines are measuring centrifugal effects and require only a one-time calibration. There are three main types of balance machines based on their application: </p> <ul>  <li>Horizontal balancing machines</li> <li>Vertical balancing machines</li> <li>Universal or special balancing machines</li> </ul> <h3>Horizontal axis balancing machine </h3> <p>These types of machines are mainly used for two plane (Dynamic) balancing. Single plane (Static) balancing is also possible. The rotor runs with its axis of spin in a horizontal plane. </p> <h3>Vertical axis balancing machine </h3> <p>These types of machines are mainly used for two plane (Dynamic) balancing. Single plane (Static) balancing is also possible. The rotor runs with its axis of spin in a vertical plane. </p> <h3>Universal or special balancing machine </h3> <p>The universal balancing machine is named for the wide variety of parts it can balance. It is also known as a cradle balancing machine because of the way the part is supported on the machine. This model of balancing machine can be used for both single and two plane rotor balancing. With the proper tooling and correction modes this \"universal\" balancer can be configured to accommodate a variety of rotors up to 20,000 lbs. There are three main types of balancing machines based on the type of unit that needs to be balanced:</p> <ul> <li> Static balancing machines </li> <li> Blade balancing machines </li> <li>Portable balancing machines</li> </ul> <p><strong>Static balancing machine</strong> Static balancing machines can test the balance of a unit without spinning. The unit is placed vertically in the centre of what looks like a scale and the pressure from the various areas of the scale measures the imbalances of the unit. This method limits the machine to measuring only one plane of the unit, but the advantages of using this kind of machine are price and speed.  <strong>Blade balancing machine</strong> Blade balancing machines endeavour to make sure parts are balanced during assembly. Fans, turbines and propellers are all good examples of common units that use this machine. For example, before a fan is assembled the blades are all weighed and a piece of software matches the blades together so as to eliminate as much imbalance as possible. <strong>Portable balancing machine</strong> Portable balancing machines are perfect for measuring the imbalances in machines whose parts cannot be disassembled. These tools come with displacement sensors and a photocell which are connected to the machine being measured. The portable balancing machine senses the vibrations of the spinning unit and calculates any adjustments that need to be made. </p> <h2>Applications of Balancing Machines</h2> <p>The following are some of the applications of balancing machines </p> <ul> <li> Armature Balancing </li> <li> Combine Rotor Balancing </li> <li> Crankshaft &amp; Engine Balancing </li> <li> Cutter Wheel Balancing </li> <li> Rotor Balancing </li> <li> Super Charger Balancing </li> <li> Clutch Balancing </li> <li> Coupling Balancing </li> <li> Flexplate Balancing </li> <li> Flywheel Balancing</li> </ul> <h2>Popular Manufacturers</h2> <p>Some of the well-known manufacturers of balancing machines are: AMERICAN HOFMANNORATION, ITW Balance Engineering, LINGLING, KAISER SISTEMAS De EQUILIBRADO, HINES INDUSTRIES, IRD Balancing,  DIAMECH 2000 Ltd., SCHENCK RoTec GmbH, CIMAT, SCHMITT EUROPE and ROLLOMATIC.</p> <p></p>"},{"id":"1347_en","content":"<p><figure id=\"attachment_8802\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8802 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/mf-2-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"furnace glass melting\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Melted glass in a furnace</figcaption></figure></p> <p><strong>Melting of metals</strong>, glass, and other materials has been a vital manufacturing process for several thousand years, producing molten liquids that can be poured and solidified into useful shapes. Since the dawn of the industrial age, the tremendous progress in the melting process equipment (melting furnaces), the range of molten materials, control on thermal behavior and the complexity of the finished products has enabled cast components to be an integral part of various products such as automobiles, power generators, oil pipelines, medical instruments, etc. <strong>The process of melting is accomplished for years with the help of a furnace.</strong> A furnace is an equipment to melt ferrous or non-ferrous metals for casting or simply heat materials for changing their shape or for altering their mechanical and metallurgical properties (heat treatment). An ideal <strong>furnace</strong> should melt as much of material as possible to a uniform temperature with the least possible fuel and labor.</p> <h3><strong>Furnace and its Parts</strong></h3> <p>A typical furnace is constructed with the help of the following <strong>principal components</strong>:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Steel Shell</strong> – For supporting and casing</li> <li><strong>Refractory chamber</strong> – Made of insulating materials to retain heat at higher operating temperatures</li> <li><strong>Hearth</strong> - To support or carry the steel.

For most of the heating equipments, a large amount of the heat supplied is wasted in the form of exhaust gases. Furnaces operate with relatively low efficiencies at around 7% when compared to other combustion equipments such as boilers which are very efficient at an efficiency rate of 90%. T<strong>he low efficiency of melting furnaces can be attributed to the high operating temperatures in the furnace and significant heat losses.</strong> The major factor which affects the energy efficiency of a furnace is the heat losses due to the following reasons:</p> <p>• Heat storage in the furnace structure</p> <p>• Losses from the furnace outside walls or structure</p> <p>• Heat transported out of the furnace by the load conveyors, fixtures, trays, etc.</p> <p>• Radiation losses from openings, hot exposed parts, etc.</p> <p>• Heat carried by the cold air infiltration into the furnace</p> <p>• Heat carried by the excess air used in the burners.</p> <p>A furnace is <strong>carefully selected by giving due consideration to the following factors</strong>: type and composition of the metal to be melted, maximum temperature required (melting point of the metal), delivery rate of the molten metal (pouring rate), mode of discharging the molten metal, initial set-up and operational cost.</p> <h3><strong>Types of Furnaces</strong></h3> <p>Furnaces can be classified based upon several aspects into various types. Furnaces are broadly classified into two types based on the heat generation method as <strong>combustion melting furnaces which use fuels to melt and electric melting furnaces in which electricity is utilized to melt the metal</strong>. Combustion melting furnaces can be further sub-divided into three types based on the kind of fuel used: oil fired, gas fired and coal fired. Furnaces in general are also classified based on the mode of charging as Intermittent or Batch, Periodical (Forging, Pot melting furnaces) and Continuous (Pusher, Walking beam, Walking hearth and rotary hearth melting furnaces). One more way of categorizing the melting furnaces is based on the mode of waste heat recovery (Recuperative and Regenerative). Based on the mode of heat transfer to the stock, the <strong>melting furnaces are classified into two types as Radiation (from the flame, hot combustion products, furnace walls and roof) and Convection (movement of hot gases over the surface of the metal)</strong>.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_8799\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8799 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/mf-3-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"Crucible Furnace\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crucible Furnace for melting aluminium</figcaption></figure></p> <p>Some of the commonly used melting furnaces are discussed below:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Crucible Furnaces</strong> – This is the least expensive melting method preferred for melting small volumes of non-ferrous metals such as bronze, brass, alloys of zinc and aluminium. Metal is melted without direct impingement of the burning fuel mixture with this <strong>small melting furnace</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Cupola Furnaces</strong> – They are vertical cylindrical furnace equipped with a tapping spout near base and are used primarily for the melting of cast iron in the large tonnage foundries. The energy efficiency of cupola melting ranges from 40 to over 70%.</li> <li><strong>Induction Melting Furnace</strong> – Heating in an induction furnace is based on the basic principle of electromagnetic induction and joule’s heating effect. It employs an electric coil which produces a charge.</li> <li><strong>Electric Melting Furnace</strong> (Arc) – They use electrodes that are lowered to strike an arc on the cold scrap and the arc provides heat by radiation and current resistance through the metal to melt the scrap. An inherent advantage of melting by electrical arc is the lower metal loss.</li> <li><strong>Immersion Heaters</strong> – They are typically used for low temperature melting of zinc alloys. The heat is generated by combustion or electrical resistance inside a tube submerged in molten material.</li> <li><strong>Oxy Fuel Furnace</strong> – It uses a fuel gas such as propane, natural gas or acetylene combined with oxygen and heat from combustion melts the charge.</li> </ul> <h3>Melt Furnace Manufacturers</h3> <p>SECO/WARWICK, GADDA, Can-Eng Furnaces International Limited, Fives Stein, UTTIS, Inductotherm, CARBOLITE, Ambrell, Topcast and Nabertherm are some of the companies worldwide involved in the production of various kinds of melting furnaces.  </p></p>"},{"id":"1348_en","content":"<h3>Precision Measuring Tools Used to Increase Quality</h3> <p><figure id=\"attachment_6963\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-6963 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/DEA_3D_Measuring_machine-300x225-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Measuring machine with PC\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Testing machines are a vital part in keeping quality control and safety.</figcaption></figure></p> <p>The <strong>requirements</strong> for <strong>technical products</strong> are <strong>continually increasing.</strong> In addition to increased capacity and robustness, the working life of the product has to be calculated as exactly as possible.

Coordinate measurement machine have made inspection of parts very much easier. Basically, they consist of a platform on which the workpiece being measured is placed and moved linearly or rotated. A probe attached to a head capable of lateral and vertical movements records all measurements. Coordinate measurement machines are versatile in their capability to record measurement of complex profiles with high sensitivity (0.25 µm) and speed.With the help of coordinate measuring machines one can locate point coordinates on three-dimensional objects (X, Y &amp; Z or length – width – height) all at the same time. They allow integration of both dimensions and orthogonal relationships. When linked to a computer, use of a CMM eliminates difficult and time consuming measurements with traditional single axis devices such as micrometers and height gauges. CMM machines become very useful when more complex workpieces are to be dealt with.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Coordinate Measuring Machine Types and Parts</strong></h3>\r\n<p>A CMM machine is comprised of four main elements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Main Structure – The machine incorporates the basic concept of three coordinate axes so that precise movement in x, y, and z directions is possible.</li>\r\n<li> <figure id=\"attachment_8239\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8239 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/cmm-2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"probe of machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coordinate Measuring Machines use probes to measure objects</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>Probing System – A part of the co-ordinate measuring machine which senses the different parameters required for the calculation. Many kinds of probes such as optical transmission probes, cluster probes, motorized probes and transmission trigger probes are available.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Machine Control and Computer Hardware – The control unit allows manual measurement and self-teach programming in addition to CNC operation. The control unit is microprocessor controlled. This especially refers to a CNC coordinate measuring machine.</li>\r\n<li>Software for Three-dimensional Geometry Analysis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The coordinate measuring machines and systems can be broadly classified into five different types as: Cantilever arm type, Bridge type, Column type, Horizontal arm type and Gantry type and their modes of operation is also divided into four types as Manual, Manual Computer assisted, Motorized Computer assisted and Direct Computer controlled. There is also portable arm coordinate measuring machine available when it is difficult to move the workpiece to the machine.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Advantages of Coordinate Measuring Machines</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Some of the advantages of CMM’s which make them more preferable than the conventional measuring devices are higher flexibility, reduction in labour costs (less human intervention), improved accuracy, reduced setup and improved productivity.

A mechanical press in which an eccentric, instead of a crankshaft, is used to move the ram is known as eccentric press. Whereas the eccentric is the offset portion of the driveshaft that governs the stroke or distance the crosshead moves on a mechanical or manual shear. The most commonmechanical pressesuse an eccentric drive to move the press's ram. The nature of drive system determines the force progression during the ram's stroke. Mechanical presses have a press force progression towards the bottom dead centre depending on the drive and hinge system. Mechanical presses therefore can reach higher cycles per unit of time and are usually more common in industrial press shops.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Eccentric type of press and drive is used where a very long stroke is required normally in excess of 24 inches. All of the features of a double-geared press apply to this drive design however, accuracy is not as good as an eccentric-shaft press because of the clearance with the arrangement of the gear train and the additional clearance needed in the slide guiding gib adjustment.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Construction and Working of an Eccentric Press</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The model Eccentric press simulates a mechanical press designed as a portal frame machine, as used for example in metal forming industries. The eccentric press consists of the mechanical press, a store and a pusher to insert and withdraw parts automatically.The eccentric press uses a motor to drive an eccentric shaft, rotating in a connecting rod. The connecting rod moves a ram in a slider joint one dimensionally. The eccentric shaft itself is round, therefore it may completely rotate within the connecting rod. The centre of the drive is not the centre of the overall shaft. As the motor rotates, the centre of the drive remains stable but the overall centre of the shaft changes. This causes the shaft to change position, providing motion. The actual working principle of an eccentric press is very similar to a crank press.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_10041\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10041\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/manual-eccentric-press.jpg\" alt=\"Eccentric Press Parts\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A close look on the parts of the eccentric press</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A slider crank mechanism is used to transfer the energy of flywheel through the crank, the connecting rod and finally the slide to the workpiece. A slight variation of the eccentric press is the crank press, where a crank is used instead of an eccentric shaft. The presses are sometimes differentiated by the fact that the total stroke of crank press cannot be changed whereas the total stroke of eccentric press is adjustable. These presses are recommended for short working stroke or for high speed operation. The use of the eccentric shaft reduces the effect of bending on the main shaft thus making the shaft stiffer.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The basis of the machine is a welded frame with longitudinally placed crankshaft and two connecting rods which the slide is suspended on. A change of the length of stroke is provided by adjustable eccentric bushes located in connecting rods. This solution enables optimum utilization of the press with high numbers of the slide strokes. The press drive is provided by an asynchronous motor with a frequency converter driving a flywheel over V-belts. The flywheel together with the clutch/brake and epicyclic gear form a unit fixed to the frame and connected with the crankshaft.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Advantages of Eccentric Press</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A few advantages of eccentric presses when compared to their other mechanical counterparts which make them more preferable are:</p> <ul style=\"text-align: justify\"> <li>As the mechanical press is driven by electric motors and not by a hydraulic motor, energy loss in the machine is limited and the output in relation to power consumption is thus optimum.</li> <li>A mechanical press has considerably longer lifetime than a hydraulic press. In the long run the mechanical press gives a much better return on investment than a hydraulic press.</li> <li>High production rates</li> <li>Low machining time and lower costs for maintenance</li> <li>Moving bolsters ensure short changeover times</li> </ul> <ul style=\"text-align: justify\"> <li>Minimal slide deflection under off-centre loading</li> <li>Modular design of the press series permits cost-effective, customer-specific solutions</li> <li>Numerous options such as drawing cushions, etc. are available to custom-tailor the line to the customer's needs</li> </ul> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Applications of Eccentric Press</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Eccentric Presses have a very wide range of applications.

It is the oldest of the metal working process known. The forging process dates back to 4000 B.C. and evolved from the manual art of simple blacksmithing. From simple drop hammers and anvils which were operated manually water, air and steam powered hammers came into use after the industrial revolution. Later, the smiths of those days started using hammers driven by transmission shafts to produce a wide range of forged parts for the railways, for the car industry and for agricultural machinery. Modern forging uses machine driven impact hammers or presses which deform the work piece by controlled pressure.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Hot and Cold Forging</strong></h3> <figure id=\"attachment_8449\" style=\"width: 280px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-8449\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/fg-3-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"prepare hot forging\" width=\"280\" height=\"155\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Preparing the metal bar for the forging</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Hot forging is defined as working a metal above its recrystallization temperature while in cold forging the metal is worked far below its recrystallization temperature. In simple terms, <strong>hot forging is carried out at fairly elevated temperatures while cold forging is done at room or near room temperatures.</strong> Cold forging requires heavier forces and stronger equipments but the dimensional accuracy and surface finish produced on the part will be excellent. Even though lighter forces perform the function in hot forging, the precision on tolerance is less due to thermal contraction and warping from uneven cooling. Also undesirable reactions between the metal and the surrounding atmosphere and contaminations take place at higher temperature which are minimized during cold forging.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Forging Machines and Forging Tools</strong></h3> <figure id=\"attachment_8451\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8451\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/fg-1-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"drop hammer forging\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forming hot metal with a drop hammer</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">There are basically two types of forging equipment namely: <strong>forging hammers and forging presses.</strong> Hammers can be further divided into two types as <strong>drop hammers and counter blow hammers</strong>. The main variations among drop hammers is in the way that the hammer is powered: by air, gravity, friction or steam. Drop hammers are usually operated in vertical position. To overcome some of the limitations of drop hammers like high noise, requirement of a large foundation impact or counter blow hammers were used. In a counterblow machine both the hammer and anvil move and the work piece is held between them thereby the excess energy becomes recoil which allows for the machine to work horizontally and consist of a smaller base. Forging presses can be sub-divided based on the powering mechanism as <strong>mechanical presses and hydraulic presses.</strong> Mechanical presses function by using cams, toggles and cranks to give pre-determined force. Hydraulic presses employ fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. Mechanical presses are very faster than their hydraulic counterparts. But hydraulic ones are more flexible with greater capability. The initial set-up cost for a hydraulic press is relatively higher than the same for the mechanical press.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Types of Forging Machines</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Forging metal can be classified into three types according to the degree to which the flow of the metal is constrained by the dies:</p> <ul style=\"text-align: justify\"> <li>Open die forging </li> <li>Impression die forging </li> <li>Flashless forging</li> </ul> <figure id=\"attachment_8462\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8462\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/fg-4-300x156.jpg\" alt=\"Open  die forging\" width=\"300\" height=\"156\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Give the metal another form with open die forging</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Open die forging also known as upsetting involves compression of a work between two flat dies, or platens with the absence of any lateral constraints which there is very less restriction to metal flow. It basically<strong> reduces the height of the job by increasing the diameter.</strong> Open die forging is performed on ingots, billets, or a pre-formed shape. Graphite based lubricants are used during this type of metal forging process. Pancaking or barreling can occur during upsetting due to the frictional forces present at the die-work piece interface or due to the thermal differences. Closed die or impression forging is done in one or in a series of die impressions or die cavities. Simple shapes may be forged in a single stroke while more complicated pieces may pass through several strokes and die cavities before achieving their final form. During the final forging, a <strong>thin layer of excess material flows radially outward around the periphery of the die metal, which is termed as the flash.</strong> The flash is subsequently trimmed off manually or by using specialized dies. Press forging and drop forging are two popular methods in closed die forging. Both open and closed die forging processes are carried out at room temperature as well as in hot state. In flashless forging as the name suggests, the die <strong>tooling is designed in such a way that the cavity does not allow the formation of a flash</strong>. The work material is completely surrounded by the die cavity during compression and hence no flash is formed. Control over the process is more demanding than impression die forging. Most important requirement in flashless forging is that the work volume must equal the space in the die cavity to a very close tolerance.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Advantages and Applications of Forging Machinery</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">All metals and their alloys with a very few exception can be forged. Many metals are forged cold, but iron and its alloys are almost always forged hot.<strong> Forging results in metal that is stronger than cast or machined metal parts.</strong> This can be attributed to the grain flow caused through forging process. As the metal is pounded the grains deform to follow the shape of the part, thus the grains are unbroken throughout the part. Therefore some modern parts take advantage of this for a high strength-to-weight ratio. Forge equipment is now capable of making parts ranging in size of a bolt to a turbine rotor. Typical parts: bolts, rivets, engine crankshafts, connecting rods, turbine shafts, coins, gears, hand tools, structural components of machinery or aircraft, jet engine parts. Also, basic small scale industries use forging processes to establish basic shape of large parts that are subsequently machined to final geometry and size.</p> <p></p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Forging Manufacturers</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">FAGOR, SCHULER, AIDA, FICEP, KOMATSU, DEYI, AEM3, DIMECO, Bliss-Bret, Beckwood, WANZKE, MHG and MECOLPRESS are some of the well-known brands in the world involved in the production of forging presses. </p>"},{"id":"1390_en","content":"<p>A manipulator is a part of an <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/robots\">industrial robot</a></strong> that undertakes the <strong><strong>mechanical functions. </strong></strong>The manipulator is used to instruct the robot and give it tasks.

Jules Verne first used the word “robot” for these types of machines at the end of the 19th century. After the military gained great interest in the development and use of these machines, George Devol (USA) created the first patented programmable robotic manipulator in 1954. In the following years, the first industrial robots were used and further developed. In 1973, the “KUKA Roboter GmbH” produced the “FAMULUS”, an industrial robot with six electro-magnetic powered axles. One year later, a Swedish company presented their electrically-powered robots. From this point, and up until today, this basic principle of the industrial robot has not changed a lot. However, thanks to the steady development of robots, they <strong><strong>work more efficiently, safely and have more possibilities, as well as smaller and lighter machines</strong></strong><strong>.</strong></p> <h2><strong>Areas of application and the function of a manipulator in industry</strong></h2> <p>There are numerous areas where manipulators can be applied. In industry, they are used for assembly processes like <strong><strong>welding, gluing, soldering or riveting components</strong></strong>. They also often support components in production machines, like moving them from the machine onto the conveyor belt. Further tasks include <strong><strong>holding the tools</strong></strong> for processing, or measuring. Depending on the area of application, the industrial manipulator is usually equipped with a <strong><strong>tool</strong></strong>: the manipulator of a welding robot is equipped with a welding head; the manipulator of a measuring robot has a <strong><strong>sensor</strong></strong>; a robot used to hold or transport goods generally requires a gripping or a magnetic head. In many cases, the tool on the mechanical arm can be changed in order to be able to work more flexibly.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_7719\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7719 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/mani-2-300x222.jpg\" alt=\"Manipulator robot\" width=\"300\" height=\"222\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Manipulators give support in production machines</figcaption></figure> <p>The <strong><strong>translatory or rotating movements </strong></strong>of the manipulator are always determined by a <strong><strong>sensor</strong></strong>. This measures, for example, the distance of the tool from the workpiece and workpiece's dimensions. This information is then processed in the robot's programme and then delivered onto the mechanics, which then moves the robot. Depending on the area of application, the manipulator either moves from a <strong><strong>fixed location, </strong></strong>using a jointed<strong><strong> manipulator arm, </strong></strong>and the workpiece stays in once place. Or the robotic manipulator itself is fixed, while the workpiece is moved, either by the table or another part of the robot. If a manipulator can only move one coordinate axis, then it doesn't make sense to use a manipulator with an expensive sensor system to try creating a straight seam using welding. If a component has a <strong><strong>complex shape</strong></strong> then it is essential to use a welding robot with a complex, mechanical, mobile manipulator. A manipulator is useful, even with changeable component dimensions, or varying movements in production. Manual manipulators are also available, in addition to the <strong>programmable and fully-automatic manipulators</strong>. The manual manipulator is usually used in dangerous areas, for example, mine fields, a nuclear power plant or under the sea where there is high pressure. These can either be controlled using a <strong><strong>joystick </strong></strong>or<strong><strong> remote control.</strong></strong></p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Types of industrial manipulators</strong></h2> <p>Industrial robots are a standard machine. The manipulator fits the area of operation and the tools that the robot uses. The types of manipulators are determined by its direction of movement: parallel or serial kinematics.

There are various systems available that all work around the same principle. At the welding spot, a workpiece is joined to metal edge using liquefied heat. Welding machines and mig welders are used to facilitate the joining of metals by coalescence. This involves applying intense heat to melt a portion of the metals to be joined so that they intermix. Often another material is added to form a stronger joint when cooled. The molten metals then flow into one another and solidify again. This creates a permanent bond between the two work pieces.  </p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_26311\" style=\"width: 474px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-26311\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/MILLER-Millermatic-252-mig-welder-1024x970.jpg\" alt=\"MILLER Millermatic 252 mig welder\" width=\"474\" height=\"449\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">MILLER Millermatic 252 mig welder is used to joining metal workpieces</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>What are the different types of Welding Machines?</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Arc Welding Machines.</strong><br />Arc welding creates an electric arc between electrodes, a positive charge anode and a negative charge cathode, to create an intense heat. Metal arc welding systems are those in which the electrode is melted off to become a part of the weld.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Spot Welding Machines</strong><br /> A spot welding machine is used to join contacting metal surfaces together. This is done by means of a pair of shaped copper electrodes to focus the welding current in one particular spot whilst the two pieces of metal are clamped together. The heat generated by resistance to the electric current will melt the metal, and form a weld. Spot welding machines can deliver a large amount of energy in a short burst, so that there is little or no unnecessary heating of the rest of the sheet metal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Portable Welding Machines</strong><br />These are arguably the most popular type of welding machine.

The counterblow hammer is another variation of the power-drop hammer, which is widely used in Europe. The major advantage of counter blow hammers is that they operate at very high speeds but with less vibration transmitted to the foundation. These hammers develop striking force by the movement of two rams which are simultaneously approaching from opposite directions and meeting at a midway point. Some hammers are pneumatically or hydraulically actuated while others incorporate a mechanical hydraulic or a mechanical pneumatic system.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Construction and Working of a Counterblow Hammer</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The basic components of a counter blow hammer are: Drive (hydraulic, pneumatic etc.), Upper Ram, Upper die, Hammer frame, Lower die, Lower ram and Hydraulic ram clutch. In a vertical counter blow hammer with a steam-hydraulic actuating system, steam is admitted to the upper cylinder and drives the upper ram downward. At the same time, pistons connected to the upper ram act through a hydraulic linkage in forcing the lower ram upward. Retraction speed is increased by steam (or air) pressure acting upward on the piston. Through proper design relative to weights (including tooling and work piece) and hydraulics (slower lower-assembly velocities), the kinetic energy of the upper and lower assemblies can be balanced at the impact. Horizontal counter blow hammers have two opposing, die-carrying rams that are moved horizontally by compressed air. Heated stock is positioned automatically at each die impression by a preset pattern of accurately timed movements of a stock handling device. A 90° rotation of stock can be programmed between the blows.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Counterblow Hammer and its Advantages</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The rams of a counter blow hammer are capable of striking repeated blows and they develop combined velocities of 5 to 6 m/s (6 to 20 ft/s). Compared to single action hammers, the vibration of impact is reduced, and approximately the full energy of each blow is delivered to the work piece, without loss to an anvil. As a result, the wear of moving hammer parts is minimized, contributing to longer operating life of the machine. At the time of impact, forces are cancelled out, and hence no energy is lost to the foundation. In fact, counterblow hammers do not require the large inertia blocks and foundations needed for conventional power drop hammers which involve comparatively high intense vibrations. </p>"},{"id":"1391_en","content":"<p>A <strong>forge hammer</strong> is any hammer or hitting implement that is used during the metal forging process, in order to give shape and to beat out inconsistencies from the metal.

As in shaping machines, during the planing process as well the length and position of the stroke can be adjusted and only single point cutting tools are used for material removal. Both shaping and planing machines can also be <strong>exploited to produce large curved surfaces</strong> by employing suitable attachments. For machining grooves in curved sections, form tools are utilized in both the machines. Also most importantly both the machining processes work based on the same cutting principle. Even though there are striking similarities between the two processes, there are a few notable differences between the two of them. In planing machine, instead of the tool, the work piece is given a reciprocatory action thereby responsible for the fast cutting motion and instead of the job, the tool is given the slow feed motion while in shaping machines, it is vice versa. When compared to shaping machines, <strong>planer machines are much larger and more rugged</strong> in construction and are generally used for machining large jobs with longer stroke length and heavy cuts. A metal power planer machine is also more productive than a shaping machine.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Cutting Mechanism</strong></h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7420\" style=\"width: 200px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7420 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/metal_planing_machine_2-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"metal planing machine\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The quick interchange of the table increase the number of strokes per minute</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>The planing machine has a relatively simpler kinematic system which enables the transmission and transformation of rotary motion of the main motor into reciprocating motion of the <strong>large work table and the slow transverse feed motions</strong> (both horizontal and vertical) of the tools. The reciprocation of the table, which imparts cutting motion to the job, is attained by the rack and pinion mechanism. The rack is fitted with the table at its bottom surface and the pinion is fitted on the output shaft of the speed gear box. This kind of arrangement not only enables to change the number of stroke per minute but is also responsible for the quick return of the table thus reducing the time taken for the return stroke. The tool head which holds the cutting tools can be moved horizontally along the cross rail by screw nut system and the cross rail is supported by the column of the machine. Just like the ones used in turning process, the cutting tool used for material removal is a single point cutting tool. The only difference is that the cutting tool for planing must be more rigid as the tool is not subjected to any kind of reciprocatory motion and just feed motion. Also higher tool rigidity is required to withstand the <strong>higher impact cutting forces</strong>. The clearance angle of the tool also must be bigger to avoid plunging of the cutting tool into the machined surface during the quick return of the ram over the work piece.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Types of Metal Planers</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Planing machines can be classified into two types as <strong>open side planers and double-column planers</strong>. The open side planer, also called as the single column planer has a single column supporting the cross rail on which the tool head is mounted. Width of the parts that can be machined in a single column planer is larger owing to the configuration of the machine. A double column planer has two columns, one on either side of the bed and the worktable. Just like in an open side planer, the columns support the cross rail on which one or more tool heads are mounted. Rigidity and robustness of the double column planers is quite high when compared to open type planers because of the presence of two columns but it has a limitation in the width of the work piece that can be handled in the planer machine.</p>\r\n<h2>Application and Advantages of Planers</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7421\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7421 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/metal_planing_machine_3-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"metal planing machine control pannel\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Compared to shaping machines, planing machines are more skillful</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>All the operations that can be done in shaping machines can be performed in a planing machine as well. But larger size and stroke length and higher rigidity enable the planing machines to do more heavy duty work on large jobs and long surfaces. The <strong>productivity of the planing machines is also far superior </strong> when compared to shaping machines for longer and faster stroke, heavy cuts. There is also possibility of simultaneously using a number of tools in a electric planer which further enhances the production capacity of the planing machine leading to a great amount of reduction in lead time. The most common application of planers is the machining of salient features like the principal surfaces and guide ways of beds and tables of various universally used industrial machines like lathes, milling machines, grinding machines, broaching machines, shapers and planing machines itself etc. Besides this the planers are also utilized for machining long parallel T slots, ‘V’ and inverted ‘V’ type guide ways. The power planers are also employed for few critical machining activities like helical grooving on large rods, long and wide two dimensional curved surfaces and making repetitive oil grooves etc. with the help of suitable special attachments.</p>\r\n<h2>Buying Used Planers Rather ?</h2>\r\n<p>If you are looking for a planing machine for sale have you considered buying used hand planers rather than new? It may not have been the first option that sprang to mind, but it will be by far the most cost effective one. This is because new machinery and equipment tends to be expensive, whereas going the pre-owned route can save you half the price of what you would pay for a new planing machine, or perhaps even more if you look carefully at what's available. If you are looking at developing new markets or <strong>expanding your business</strong>, or even if you are simply on a tight budget, then any savings you can make will lead to finances being available for other projects. Checking out the electric planers for sale at used industrial machinery auctions will help you to realise just where those savings might be made. If your concern is that used planers may be a false economy, think again.

A common application of <strong>honing process</strong> is to<strong> finish the internal cylindrical surface</strong>. It also improves the form tolerance of the holes. Honing uses bonded abrasives just as in grinding while loosened abrasives are used in lapping &amp; polishing. The point of contact during honing is not just a line as in grinding instead a complete area of the tool. In addition to the surface finish of about 0.1 µm, honing produces a characteristic crosshatched surface that tends to retain lubrication during operation of the component, thus contributing to its function and service life.</p> <h2>Honing Tool</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_8430\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8430\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/hom-3-300x100.jpg\" alt=\"Honing with oil \" width=\"300\" height=\"100\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Honing oil to lubricate the tool, remove chips and cool</figcaption></figure> <p>The honing tool performs a combined rotary and reciprocating motion while the work piece does not perform any working motion. The point behind providing rotational and reciprocating movements is to <strong>give an uneven ratio</strong> and thus prevent an abrasive grain from ever traversing its own path twice. Also this type of a complex rotational and oscillatory axial motion of the hone is responsible for the crosshatched lay pattern of very low surface roughness. The abrasive sticks or stones are equally spaced about the periphery of the hone tool. The abrasives are held against the work surface with controlled light pressure usually exercised by small springs. The abrasive action of the honing tool removes material from the inside diameter of the part. <strong>A cutting fluid (honing oil) must be used in honing to cool and lubricate the tool and to help remove the chips.</strong> It also prevents pickup (spot welding of tool to bore) and loading (chips coating the stone).</p> <h2><strong> Selection of Abrasives</strong></h2> <p>For a required surface finish and material removal rate, the abrasive stones should be selected based on the flowing parameters: Type of abrasive, Grit size and Hardness. The four types of abrasives used are: Aluminium oxide, Silicon carbide, Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) and Diamond. Among these, Aluminium oxide is the most commonly used abrasive in industrial applications. <strong>CBN and Diamond are used for very hard materials</strong> and are called super abrasives. Coarse grains are used for faster stock removal and fine grains are used when less material removal rate and fine finish are required. Coarse grains are used for ductile materials and fine grains are used for hard and brittle materials.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8434\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8434 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/hom-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Vertical honing machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vertical honing machine in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>Types of Honing Machines: Vertical and Horizontal</strong></h2> <p>There are two types of honing machines:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Vertical Honing Machine</strong></li> <li><strong>Horizontal Honing Machine</strong></li> </ul> <p>Vertical honing machines hold the work piece and the honing tool with their axes in the vertical position while in horizontal honing machines both the work as well as the tool are held with their axes in horizontal direction. <strong>Vertical machines are suited for shorter jobs while horizontal machines are preferred for longer jobs.</strong> Part lengths up to 2000 mm are usually honed in vertical machines and jobs of more than 2000 mm length are honed in horizontal machines.</p> <p>On TradeMachines, you have the possibility to find a wide choice of honing machines for sale, including <strong>sunnen honing machine</strong>, <strong>cylinder honing machine</strong>, <strong>portable honing machine</strong>, <strong>CNC honing machine</strong>, engine honing machine, etc.</p> <h2><strong> Advantages and Disadvantages of Honing</strong></h2> <figure id=\"attachment_8433\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8433 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/hom-2-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"horizontal honing machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Honing with a horizontal honing machine</figcaption></figure> <p>The <strong>honing process</strong> offers advantages of low capital equipment cost, high metal removal rates, and extreme accuracy of 0.001mm in a wide variety of materials. It gives relatively high productivity when compared to a lapping machine. Several holes can be honed simultaneously on multiple spindle machines. Other advantages include the <strong>ability to create round and straight bores in relatively long work pieces, freedom from heat effects</strong> etc. It avoids surface damage due to heat as can occur with grinding operations. As there is no motion involved with the work piece, there are no chucks, faceplates, or rotating tables needed thereby eliminating chances of chucking or locating errors. The hone is driven from a central shaft, so bending of the shaft cannot cause tapered holes as it does when boring. The resultant crosshatch pattern of honing is very efficient in a moving bearing application such as an automotive cylinder bore honing tool or a valve body bore, since the peaks carry the load of the mating part and the valleys in the surface structure provides reservoirs for lubricating oil.</p> <p>Honing machine process can be used to correct the following bore errors generated during the previous operations:</p> <ul> <li>Curvature</li> <li>Conicity</li> <li>Taper</li> <li>Waviness</li> <li>Undersize</li> <li>Lack of Roundness</li> </ul> <p><strong>Honing equipment</strong> can also correct parts that are not square, within limits. But the major constraint is that the part must have convenient clamping pads as work piece distortion during application of the process will not be caused. As the honing tool also gets worn out quickly, it <strong>should be sharpened from time to time</strong> for maintaining the quality of the products. Also the initial equipment cost is quite high when compared to other finishing processes. Hence, it is advisable to go for <strong>used honing machines for sale</strong> when cost restriction plays an important role.</p> <h2>Used Honing Machines for Sale</h2> <p>Here at Trademachines we can offer you some of the honing machines from manufacturers all over the  world : GEHRING Technologies, SUNNEN, ENGIS, CENTURY Machine, OSBORN, SOMOS International and OHIO Tool Works. </p> <p></p>"},{"id":"1410_en","content":"<p>A slotter or slotting machine is basically a heavy duty <strong>shaping machine</strong> in which the <strong>cutting tool moves vertically</strong>. The ram is mounted on an independent bearing, the upper part of which is pivoted to shift the ram in any angular position. The job is generally supported on a round table that has a rotary feed in addition to the usual table movements in cross-directions. Thus the work table can be given transverse, longitudinal or rotary movement. A slotting machine works on the same principle as an ordinary shaper except that the ram which carries the tool moves in the vertical direction at right angles to the work piece. Slotters are commonly used for <strong>internal machining of blind holes</strong>, key ways, recesses and also for the cutting of internal and external teeth on large gears.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9779\" style=\"width: 176px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-9779\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/slotting-machine.jpg\" alt=\"used slotting machine for sale\" width=\"176\" height=\"304\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Slotter in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <h2>Shaping vs. Slotting</h2> <p>The chief difference between a shaper and a slotter is the <strong>direction of the cutting action</strong>. The cutting tool moves vertically up and down while performing the cutting operation as against the horizontal to and fro motion in a shaper. Also the depth of cut is adjusted by moving the cutting tool horizontally in a slotter machine whereas vertical movement of the tool in a shaper is responsible for determining the depth of cut. Slotting machines are characterized by <strong>longer stroke length</strong> than shaping machines. They are also less strong and rigid comparatively. And slotting machines are used mostly for machining internal surfaces while shapers are predominantly used for machining flat surfaces.</p> <h2>Specification of a Slotter</h2> <p>Slotters are generally specified in terms of the<strong> maximum length of a stroke</strong>. A little consideration will show that the size of the job that can be machined will be less than this size by an amount equal to the top and bottom clearances of the tool. The ram stroke of a slotter for sale ranges from 300 to 1800 mm. <strong>Longitudinal &amp; transverse feeds range</strong> from 0.05 to 2.5 mm/stroke. There is also a possibility of<strong> tilting the ram</strong> up to 15 degrees on both the sides from vertical permitting the machining of dies with relief. <strong>Ram speeds</strong> usually vary from 2 to 40m/min. The other common specifications of a slotting machine are: Work table diameter (mm), Transverse movement of the table (mm), Longitudinal movement of the table (mm), Motor Power (KW), Maximum distance between tool post to bed (mm) and Maximum distance between ram guide and work table (mm).</p> <h2>Slotting Drive</h2> <p>In a slotting machine, the cutting action is performed during downward stroke. The mechanism of slotter should be designed in such a way that the ram should move slowly during the cutting stroke and should move fast during the return stroke, thereby the idle time of the machine is reduced. This mechanism is known as Quick return Mechanism. This can be achieved by three means:</p> <ul> <li>Crank &amp; Slotted Link - <strong>Slotted disc mechanism</strong></li> <li>Driving wheels &amp; Trunnion - <strong>Slotted link and gear mechanism</strong></li> <li>Hydraulic Power - <strong>Hydraulic mechanism</strong></li> </ul> <figure id=\"attachment_9778\" style=\"width: 151px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-9778\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/slotter-machine.jpg\" alt=\"Slotter machine with hydraulic mechanism in a workshop\" width=\"151\" height=\"267\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hydraulic powered ram of a slotter</figcaption></figure> <p>Cutting speed depends on <strong>Stroke length, Number of strokes and Quick return ratio</strong> which is the ratio of the duration of forward stroke to the return stroke. Quick return ratio usually varies between 2:1 and the practical limit is 3:2. Some of the advantages of a hydraulically powered slotter over the other mechanisms are:</p> <ol> <li>Greater flexibility of speed</li> <li>Smoother in operation</li> <li>Ability to slip in case of overload, thereby eliminating tool and machine damage</li> <li>Possibility of changing speeds and feeds during operation</li> <li>Providing a constant speed all over the stroke.</li> </ol> <h2>Types of Slotters</h2> <p>The slotting machines can fall into any of the following three types:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Puncher Slotter</strong></li> <li><strong>Production Slotter</strong></li> <li><strong>Tool room Slotter</strong></li> </ul> <p>The puncher slotters are heavy duty machines equipped with powerful motor. As the length of the stroke is very large in these kind of slotter machines, they are commonly used for removing large amount of material from large castings or forgings. Production slotters are used for general production work which does not involve greater precision &amp; accuracy. The third type of slotting machine is lighter and operable at higher speeds. It is of the precision type and used for very accurate machining.

There are two different types of machines available that can process tubes of almost all diameters and wall thicknesses.<strong> Tube bending machines with a single clamp</strong>, clamp the pipe in on one side and then bend it into the defined profile. The tube is nestled along the whole area concerned and then only released when the desired radius is reached. This process works at a very high level of precision and can produce consistent quality, even for mass produced bent tubes.</p>\r\n<p>The second type of basic structure of a <strong>pip</strong><strong>e bending machine </strong>is the machine<strong> made out of three movable rollers</strong>. These rollers can be switched out to exactly fit the diameter of the tube. The rollers are positioned in an equilateral triangle. The tube is then placed into the machine and the middle roller is hydraulically driven in between the other two rollers. The distance between the two static rollers and the length of travel of the moveable roller depends on the radius of the curvature of the tube. This process is particularly suited for individual pieces, custom made products or assembly work on construction sites.</p>\r\n<h3>The Range of Pipe Bending Machines</h3>\r\n<p>Pneumatically operated tube bending machines are used to mass produce cannulas and small tubes of a similar size. The tube bending machines, which operate using a lever and muscle power, are most often used in workshops. Operating these tools requires some experience and one can quickly learn how to produce good results. The manufacturing or adjustment of exhaust pipes for automobiles can be offered very cheaply when produced using this method. There are even hand operated pipe bending machines available for stronger or particularly hard materials like stainless steel, which are partly hydraulically operated. Similar to hydraulically operated jacks, these machines bend the tube using a pressure cylinder and a radius profile. <strong>More powerful CNC controlled pipe bending machines </strong>are used for industrial settings. These undertake the whole forming process in one stage. Particularly high-end workstations of this kind also offer laser processing. Using this feature, one machine can produce a complex and high-end component for special application within a series.</p>\r\n<h2>Used Pipe Bending Machines in Metalworking Auctions</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7494\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7494 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/tube_bending_machine_1-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"another example tube bending machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pipe bending machines are used in a variety of industries</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>TradeMachines offers a broad selection of <strong>industrial pipe bending machines</strong>, allowing you to find exactly the right solution to your manufacturing needs.

Lapping produces smooth, flat, dimensionally accurate surfaces. The major difference between lapping operation and other finishing processes like Grinding &amp; Honing is the usage of loosened abrasive particles instead of bonded abrasives as cutting edges. Also a high-quality surface finish of up to 0.1 µm and a very tight tolerance, as small as ±0.00005 mm is achieved in lapping compared to the ±0.0025 mm achieved during grinding.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8883\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8883\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/lm-1-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"Large lapping machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Large lapping machine working</figcaption></figure> <p>Lapping can be performed<strong> manually by hand as well as by machines</strong> but lapping machines accomplish the process with greater consistency and efficiency. Also hand lapping is rarely used as it is expensive and requires high level of skill. The major parts of a lapping machine are: <strong>lapping plate, lapping table, abrasives and the lapping fluid or the vehicle.</strong> In lapping, two surfaces are rubbed together with a lapping medium (lapping fluid and lapping grit) trapped between them. Material is removed by countless loose particles between the carrier surface (lapping plate) and the work piece pressed against it.</p> <h2>Lapping Plates and Abrasives</h2> <p>Lapping plates, or simply laps, can be classified into four categories:</p> <ul> <li>Soft working plates (Paper, Cloth, Wood)</li> <li>Hard working plates (Cast iron, Steel, Soft ceramics)</li> <li>Hardened working plates (Hardened cast iron, Hardened steel, Hard ceramics)</li> <li>Multi-metal plates (Combination of 2-3 metals)</li> </ul> <figure id=\"attachment_8884\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8884 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/lm-2-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"Lapping in process\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workpieces in lapping machine</figcaption></figure> <p>Abrasive particles in the form of loose grains are suspended in a fluid thereby forming a slurry. <strong>Oil is the most preferred vehicle which carries the abrasive grains.</strong> Grease are also used at times. The fluid should be chosen in such a way that when large abrasive grains are used, a thick film should be selected and similarly small grains are suspended in thin films. And abrasives belong to the following four categories: Aluminium oxide, Silicon carbide, Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) and Diamond. Abrasive grit must be uniformly graded to be effective in lapping. Soft materials are lapped with Aluminium oxide and hard materials are lapped with Silicon carbide or Diamond. Particle size, distribution, hardness, shape and number of edges are the quality criteria to be considered. The particle size is chosen according to the necessary rate of material removal and surface finish required.</p> <h2>Working with a Lapping Machine</h2> <p>Lapping machines, such as valve lapping machine, back lapping machine, flat lapping machine, double sided lapping machine, center lapping machine or benchtop lapping machine, are fairly simple pieces of equipment consisting of a rotating table, the lapping plate, and three or four conditioning rings. Standard machines have lapping plates from 12 in. to 48 in. in diameter. The lapping plate is most frequently made of high-quality soft cast iron, though some are made of copper or other soft metals. <strong>The work is held in the conditioning rings which rotate.</strong> The rotation of the conditional rings plate distributes the wear so that the lapping plate stays flat for a longer time. Secondly it holds the work piece in place. The speed at which the plate turns is determined by the job being done. In doing very critical parts, 10 to 15 rpm is used. Work pieces must be pressurized by about 3 pounds per square inch (psi). Sometimes their own weight is sufficient. If not, a round, heavy pressure plate is placed in the conditioning ring. Also parts to be lapped should be placed securely in the condition rings, otherwise movement among them may lead to damages on the edges. Lapping time depends on the amount of stock to be removed, the abrasive used and the quality required.</p> <p></p> <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Lapping Machines &amp; Lapping Tools</h2> <p>Lapping procedure can be performed on any type of material and of any shape as long it is flat. Any type of material from diamond to plastics can be lapped. The type of material only affects the rate of material removal and the surface quality obtained. And as the parts are not clamped and no heat generation is involved, there is no warping which is a major advantage. Even though it is a material removal process, there are <strong>no burrs produced instead it removes those left in the primary processes.</strong> The major limitation of lapping machining is that it can be performed only on flat surfaces. Parts having very complex geometries cannot be lapped. Lapping is an art as a lot of process variables are involved and therefore highly experienced operators with sufficient skills can only handle the machines. Proper training and education should be imparted to the operators before working on the machine.</p> <h2>Lapping Machine Manufacturers</h2> <p>A few notable manufacturers of lapping machines are: PR Hoffman, Harrisons Engineering Ltd., Peter wolters, Metrolap, Rolap and Engis.</p>"},{"id":"1413_en","content":"<h2>Woodworking Machine Types &amp; Uses</h2>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_7295\" style=\"width: 319px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7295 \" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/W-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"trunk of tree\" width=\"319\" height=\"239\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wood is a versatile material</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<h4>Wood – A versatile material with the best options for processing</h4>\r\n<p>Wood has a range of characteristics that cannot be found in other materials.

Dowel driving machines, popularly known as dowel driving machines as the name suggests are used primarily to locate dowel pins into the dowel holes at specified angles and depth which can be controlled with the help of CNC (Computer numerical Control). Dowel driving machines are primarily used in wood working industries especially in the production of doors and windows.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Dowel pins are held in place by interference created around the entire pin circumference when it is pressed into a hole by a dowel driving machine. However, some applications for solid pins require clearance or transition fits on at least one of the components to be fastened. When a dowel is interference fitted into a blind hole, it increases the pressure of the air trapped in the hole. Therefore it is strongly advised to specify that the dowel should have an air release flat ground along its full length to prevent the dowel being ejected under the pressure of compressed air, or bursting the component into which it is driven. The dowel joint assembly is just like a regular screw joint except that dowel pins are used instead of screws.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Working of Dowel Inserters</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Hole piercing or drilling and positioning of dowels is extremely important for accurate insertion of dowels. Location, angle, depth and the material of construction are the factors to be considered. Dowel driving process may either include drilling of holes or a standalone dowel driving mechanism. The dowel driving machine may be as simple as dowel insertion guns or highly complex machines capable of inserting several dowel pins simultaneously. A small amount of glue into each hole in one board and the dowels are inserted into the glued holes. There should be specific control on the amount of glue applied as too much of glue will either squeeze out or make it difficult to insert the dowels. Any squeezed out glue should be immediately cleaned up. The refilling of the dowels takes place in a chute batch by batch. For precise adherence of the drilling gap to the leading edge of the work piece, a work piece stopper powered by a linear motor is used. As soon as the operator presses a switch or peddle, the machine will drive the dowel pins into the respective holes. As accurate positioning of the dowels is highly important prior to insertion, the measurement system required for positioning is directly integrated into the motor and high precision measurement systems are usually used. The drilling units if already integrated in the machine are positioned and synchronized also with the same drive.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A dowel driving machine is arranged in such a way that a single head is provided with a single shaft hole and multiple receiving holes, for independently receiving different kinds of dowels, arranged side by side in parallel. The selection is made out of the different kinds of dowel pins with different diameters and lengths supplied from chutes to the respective receiving holes. As a result, different kinds of dowels can be driven easily without much of setup time spent in changing the machine arrangement hence making the machine more suitable for integration into a continuous production line and mass production system. The dowel driving machine consists of a common base or bench and the part where the dowel should be pinned is held firmly with the help of multiple arms. Pinning of the dowels is sensor controlled for position and depth. Most of the semi-automatic dowel driving machines is pneumatic controlled.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Advanced Dowel Driving Machines</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The dowel insertion machines range from manually driven dowel insertion gun to medium sized dowel insertion jig. Also fully automated machines are also available in the market. A highly sophisticated dowel driving machine has a cycle lead time of merely five seconds for drilling, gluing and inserting pins into the holes. It is a closed loop system with a self-diagnostic programmer to control all the machine function. In advanced machines, there are multiple spindles for the drilling and inserting operation thereby multiple jobs could be carried out at the same time and the holes of varied dimensions could be also controlled based on the range of operability. Most of the semi-automatic machines are pneumatic controlled. Some of the advantages of fully automated dowel driving machines are: continuous supply of dowel pins with constant feed rate, high precision with adjustable working length and width, less labour intensive and low time consumption.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Dowel Driving Machine Manufacturers</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Some of the well-established brands involved in the manufacturing of dowel insertion machines in the world are KOCH, BIESSE, GANNOMAT, VITAP, ACCU-SYSTEMS, ELKO, CASADEI BUSELLATO, SCHEER, WEEKE, MORBIDELLI.

Therefore, it is obvious that CNC came into existence after its predecessor NC (Numerically Controlled) machines, which were hard wired. In the early 1950’s, the first numerically controlled machine was developed by the Parsons to manufacture quickly complex jet aircraft parts for the US Air Material Command. With the availability of microprocessors, the controller technology made a tremendous progress with the support of which, in the years 1970 - 1972 first Computer Numeric Control machines were developed. Punched tape continued to be used as a medium for transferring G-codes into the controller for many decades till the 1960’s, and then it was eventually superseded by RS232 cables, floppy disks, and now it is directly tied into plant networks. Modern CNC machines use software programs to provide the instructions necessary to control various operating parameters hence they are often termed as soft wired numerical control. The introduction of CNC machines drastically changed the manufacturing industry with its ability to machine curves, intricate shapes and complex 3-D structures so easily with the number of machining steps that required human effort radically reduced. </p> <h4>WHAT ARE CNC MACHINING CENTERS?</h4> <p>In conventional machine tools the motion is caused by turning cranks and handwheels, while in the case of CNC machines almost all the motions are performed through programmed commands. The motion type (rapid, linear, and circular), the axes to move, the amount of motion and the motion rate (feed rate) are programmable with almost all CNC machine tools. The machining center, developed in the late 50’s is a machine tool capable of performing machining operations simultaneously on a work part in one setup under NC program control which was later facilitated by the addition of a computer to monitor and control the entire unit. CNC Milling machines are termed as CNC machining centers and they are often retro fitted with CNC technology and some special features by removing all the mechanisms built into the machine which requires a large amount of human intervention such as hand wheels etc. Nowadays there are many milling machines which are built specifically for CNC as opposed to being retrofitted at a later stage. Some of these machines are absolutely massive and have built in tool changers, auto-feed mechanisms for loading in material and various electrical sensors for safe monitored cutting.</p> <h4>CLASSIFICATION OF CNC MACHINING CENTERS </h4> <p>Machining centers can be classified as vertical, horizontal, or universal based upon the orientation of the machine spindle: A vertical machining center has its spindle on a vertical axis relative to the work table. A vertical machining center (VMC) is typically used for flat work pieces that require tool access from the top. E.g. mould and die cavities, large components of aircraft A horizontal machining center (HMC) is used for cube shaped parts where tool access can be best achieved from the sides of the cube. A universal machining center (UMC) has a work head that swivels its spindle axis to any angle between horizontal and vertical making it a very flexible and versatile machine tool. E.g.: aerofoil shapes, curvilinear geometries. </p> <h4>FEATURES OF CNC MACHINING CENTERS</h4> <p>machining centers are usually designed in such a way with the following features so that the non-productive time is reduced to the maximum extent which make them the most preferred machines. • Automatic tool changer: The tools are contained in a storage unit that is integrated with the machine tool. When a cutter needs to be changed, the tool drum rotates to the proper position and an automatic tool changer (ATC) operating under program control, exchanges the tool in the spindle for the tool in the tool storage unit. Capacities of tool storage unit commonly range from 16 to 80 cutting tools. • Automatic work part positioner: Many horizontal and vertical machining centers have the capability to orient the work part relative to the spindle. This is accomplished by means of a rotary table on which work part is fixed. The table can be oriented at any angle about a vertical axis to permit the cutting tool to access almost the entire surface of the part in a single setup. • Automatic pallet changer: Machining centers are often equipped with two (or more) separate pallets that can be presented to the cutting tool using an automatic pallet changer. While machining is performed with one pallet in position at the machine, the other pallet is in a safe location away from the spindle. In this location, the operator can unload the finished part and then work on the raw work piece for the next cycle. </p> <h4>ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF CNC </h4> <p>When compared to the conventional CNC machine tools, the CNC machining centers are advantageous in the following ways: Reduced handling time of the parts Fewer number of steps are involved resulting in increased productivity Increased accuracy and repeatability because the parts utilize the same fixture throughout their processing The CNC machining centers are also affected with the same disadvantages of the conventional CNC machine tools like high amount of initial investment but which can be recovered very soon in the long run during mass production. The machining center should be also be well maintained as they are expensive to repair with high costs accounted for maintenance also. It is also restricted with the basic requirement of skilled CNC programmers. </p> <h4>APPLICATIONS OF CNC MACHINES </h4> <p>machines are widely used in the manufacturing industries mainly for the production of following kind of parts: Parts with complicated contours Parts requiring close tolerance and or good repeatability Parts which require complex and expensive jigs and fixtures when produced on conventional machines Parts which are to be manufactured without any room for human errors. Parts which have changing requirements like the ones which are in the development stages. Parts which are required urgently. Small batches or production lots. </p> <h2>CNC Machining Center Manufacturers</h2> <p>A few of the established suppliers of CNC machining centers in the market are: Makino, EMAG, HAAS Automation, GROB-WERKE, DMG MORI SEIKI, Mecanumeric, STAMA, OKUMA, HELLER, CHIRON, EMCO, Sodick, MAG and Hardinge Bridgeport.</p>"},{"id":"1428_en","content":"<h2>CNC Working Centres Leading Manufacturers</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7277\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7277\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/CNCM-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"used CNC Machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">CNC Working Centre in use</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Although the earliest numerical control working centres were devised in the 1940s, it is the sophisticated computers of the digital age that have enabled a greater programming complexity in control and guidance operations.

It is also used for giving the glossiness to paper surfaces. Varnishing machine is a product integrating light machinery with pneumatic control. It realizes whole-course automation and adopts belt conveying with high speed and efficiency. Machines are suitable for automatic impregnating of stators and rotors by trickle process.

The machine is semi-automatic and leaver impression of Varnish only when paper is fed. Conveyor belt stand with special arrangement for adjusting delivery tapes. Gumming is also done with this machine. According to the principle of Impregnation, activated resin is trickled in a thin jet on to the rotating preheated winding. The resin immediately gets heated and its viscosity is reduced. Due to the rotary motion of the winding the resin gets distributed evenly inside the winding without any drain loss. The heated winding accelerates the gelling and curing of the resin.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_10339\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10339\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/varnishing-machine.jpg\" alt=\"Roland RFOB Varnishing Machine\" width=\"400\" height=\"202\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">UV Varnishing Unit</figcaption></figure> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Application of Varnishing Machines</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The machine is used for both flood and spot varnishing on light and thick paper with accurate and even spot coating register.

Varnish has very good resistance against abrasion, wear, heat, solvents and water vapour.&nbsp;Varnish should be dried as quicker as possible after its application as there are chances for more dust to settle in the finish if it has a longer drying time. Varnish dryers are solutions of the metal salts of organic acids dissolved in mineral spirits. They are used in paints and varnishes to help the oils dry. They are sold based on the metal&nbsp;content of the solution, i.e. the cobalt dryer contains 6%&nbsp;cobalt metal. The varnish dryers are cobalt, calcium, manganese, zirconium, etc. Varnish dryer is an additive used to improve drying times. It is ideally used for cool or humid areas, for external projects when rain is expected or for reducing&nbsp;the time of projects which require multiple coats. The linseed oil used in oil varnishes is boiled with the addition of certain so-called dryers, of which red lead and certain compounds of manganese treated in various ways are the most important. The dryer is introduced into the oil, either directly or through the medium of the resins of lead and manganese. Linseed oil gains from 14 to 16% in weight in drying, due to the oxygen it absorbs.</p><h2>Characteristics of a Good Varnish Dryer</h2><p>  A good dryer should dry twenty parts of oil in 12 to 24 hours at the longest. The dryer should mix readily with the oil, otherwise if it separates and is insoluble, it can be put aside as of little value. The behaviour in drying should also be noted. The film of oil should dry smooth and free from crinkles and or other imperfections. Comparisons between different dryers can be made easily by this method of adding fixed, accurately measured proportions of dryer to raw oil and observing the action of the mixtures side by side. A fluid ounce of liquid contains 480 drops. 24 drops of dryer to the ounce of raw linseed oil would be about 1 part to 20. Varnishes can be tested by spreading them on glass and observing their action in drying and the nature of the surfaces they produce. Exposure to steam and the weather will develop their wearing qualities or lack of them.</p>"},{"id":"1476_en","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Automatic spraying machines used in factories are often for spray painting, but they can also be used for water depending on the type of factory.

It could be a good choice to get a wide range of used saws as there are different types and look for wood cutting saws for sale. Is very common to have used table saws.</p> <h2>The History of Wood Cutting Tools</h2> <p>Saws and saw-like tools are some of the oldest findings to come out of the early Stone Age. Saw blades made out of metal were detected in ancient Egypt. For example, a fine Egyptian woodworking saw with a saw blade made out of copper was found and <strong>dated back to 1200 BC</strong>.</p> <h2>Using Woodworking Saws</h2> <p>Nowadays to get a used wood cutting machine is something common and normal as it is that users look for the best offers or even auctions. While a smooth blade, a knife can separate material without resulting in chippings or even as wood carving tools . On the other hand, sawing results in a lot of wood chips, which separate from the work piece. The table saw is it generally made on an arbor, driven by an electric motor. The blade protrudes through the surface of a table, which gives support for the material, usually wood, being cut. Thereby, the<strong> saw blades</strong> creates a kerf, which is at least as wide as the saw blade, if not larger. In order to prevent the saw blade from getting stuck in the work piece, the teeth are normally straight-set. This means that they orient themselves to both sides and alternately face outwards. The saw blades create a similar effect; they are relief ground or curled around the area of the teeth.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_8030\" style=\"width: 327px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8030 \" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/ws-2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"circular saw\" width=\"327\" height=\"218\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of the many types of cutting wood tools is circular saws</figcaption></figure></p> <p>Bimetal tools change their form during the heating of a saw blade, so that the kerf is wider. There exist many woodworking machinery auctions where to buy wood cutting machines and used <strong>wood cutting tools</strong>. There is a limit to the length of a saw blade, which ensures that it doesn't break. This also means that most electric wood saws do not work continuously.

The saw is a continuous workflow workbench&nbsp;where the&nbsp;lumber is moved by a chain conveyer across two ripsaws, which cut off the ends of the lumber. The conveyer speed can be adjusted with a frequency converter. The double blade&nbsp;cross&nbsp;cut saw&nbsp;can be fast&nbsp;and easily&nbsp;set up depending upon the required lumber length. The setting mechanism consists of an electrical drive which moves the ripsaws closer or further apart. The exact position of the timber can be determined by using a ruler attached to the ripsaw adjustment system.</p><h4>Construction of Double Cross Cut Saw</h4><p>  The double cross cut saw is composed of two beams which are used to hold the cutting blades, the height of which can be lowered as required. These beams are positioned at such a precise angle above the board by using a check algorithm to make sure that the resulting cut is perpendicular to the side of the board. The blade carriages run on compact slides with a special integral ball bearing system driven by a highly resistant toothed belt, by means of pulleys, reducers, and electronically driven brushless motors.&nbsp;</p><p>The cutting blades are equipped with protection guards for the operator’s safety as well as for protecting the surrounding area. The work area can be kept clean by placing four suction points, two of which are mobile and the other two are located underneath the cutting surface of the board. Two pincer rollers, which have a central core with high density polyurethane covered rings, are normally placed just prior to and after the cutting area to ensure a constant board speed. These pincer rollers are driven using an electric axle to make sure that the speed at which the board advances is perfectly synchronized. The electric control of the machine provides numerous possibilities, all of which are fully programmable.</p><h4>Advantages of Double Cross Cut Saw</h4><p>  The following are some of the advantages of using double cross cut saw machine for sawing down wood:&nbsp;</p><ul>   <li>Exact cutting to size and correct angle&nbsp;</li>  <li>Perfect cutting quality &nbsp;</li>  <li>Minimum setup time&nbsp;and Rational modes of operation&nbsp;</li>  <li>Scratch and trace&nbsp;free surface&nbsp;</li>  <li>Precision throughout entire service-life</li></ul><h2>Top Manufacturers of Cross Cut Saws</h2><p>  Double Cross Cut saws get manufacturered by BALESTRINI MATCH, DGS FIORENZA, FELISATTI or RUECKLE.

They are basically used to move loads over variable ( <strong>horizontal and vertical</strong>) paths within a restricted area. They are preferred over other material handling equipments when there is insufficient or intermittent flow volume, for example when the use of a conveyor cannot be justified in the movement of goods. Cranes are more flexible in the transportation of material than the conveyors but at the same time not as flexible as industrial trucks. Loads handled by these machines are more varied with respect to their shape and weight than those handled by a conveyor. Mostly hoists are utilized by cranes for vertical movement, although manipulators can be used if precise positioning of the load is required</p> <h2>History &amp; Development of Cranes</h2> <p>They have been used <strong>since ancient times</strong>, the chimney or fireplace cranes were used to turn the pots and kettles on the fire, while the height was governed by a trammel hook. In ancient Greece, the cranes were widely used and it can also be quoted that the construction of these machines probably begun with the ancient Greeks. They played an important role in the construction of tall buildings &amp; temples. During the middle ages, they were introduced for lifting, loading and unloading ships in harbours as well as aid in their construction. It was in harbours where they developed rapidly due to the importance of trade. Later, handling machines were built heavily with the use of tread wheels, which permitted lifting of much greater weights. Nowadays machines employ internal combustion engines or electric motors or hydraulic systems to provide increased capability in lifting weights. Additionally there are the mobile ones which are mounted on trucks. When the provision of power is a major concern, manual cranes come into the picture. Today these are used extensively within the construction industry with a host of different varieties from tower to mobile cranes.</p> <h2>Types of Cranes</h2> <p>Though there are many classifications based on the purpose of use, the three main types used in industrial environments are:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"//trademachines.com/bridge-crane\"><strong>Bridge Cranes</strong></a></li> <li><a title=\"1 Apfelsortieranlage, bereits demontiert\" href=\"//trademachines.com/gantry-crane\"><strong>Gantry Cranes</strong></a></li> <li><a href=\"//trademachines.com/slewing-crane\"><strong>Jib Cranes</strong></a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Bridge Cranes </strong>: It consists of one or two horizontal beams supported between fixed rails on either end. The hoist moves along the length of the bridge, and the bridge moves along the rails. The x- and y-axes movements are provided by the above said movement and the hoist provides motion in the z-axis direction. In the bridge crane, vertical lifting is due to the hoist and horizontal movement of the material is due to the rail system. They are used in <strong>heavy machinery fabrication</strong>, <strong>steel mills</strong>, and <strong>power-generating stations</strong>. The major advantage of this handling machine is that it enables three dimensional handling with ease &amp; precision. Top riding and underhung are the two versions . Top riding is used for lifting heavier loads but the underhung cranes are the most versatile ones as they can also interface with other material handling systems.</p> <p><strong>Gantry Cranes </strong>: These types have one or two vertical legs which support the horizontal bridge. The bridge of the gantry crane has one or more hoists that help in vertical lifting. Gantries are available in a variety of sizes. <strong>Double gantry, half gantries and cantilever gantries are the different types of gantries</strong>. As the name suggests, double gantry cranes have two legs. In a half gantry crane, there is a single leg on one end of the bridge, and the other end is supported by a rail mounted on the wall or any other structural member. The bridge in a cantilever gantry crane extends beyond the length of the support legs. These types are generally used outdoors where it is not convenient to erect an overhead runway.</p> <p><strong>Jib Cranes </strong>: It consists of a hoist mounted on a horizontal cantilever beam which is supported by a vertical column. The horizontal beam is pivoted about the vertical axis formed by the column to provide a horizontal sweep for the machine. The beam acts as a track for the hoist trolley to provide radial travel along the length of the beam. The horizontal sweep of a jib crane is <strong>circular or semi-circular</strong>. The hoist provides vertical lifting and lowering movement. Hoist which is used for lifting can move along the entire length of the jib. The arm of the jib machine can rotate up to 360°</p> <h4>Other commonly used types:</h4> <p><strong>Stacker Cranes </strong>are more or less similar to bridge cranes except that, instead of a hoist, they use a mast with forks or a platform to handle unit loads. It is ultimately a <strong>crane with a fork lift type mechanism</strong> used in automated warehouses. It moves on a track in an aisle of the warehouse and the fork can be raised or lowered to any of the levels of a storage rack and can be extended into the rack to store and retrieve the products. It is used especially when more height has to be reached.</p> <p>A <strong>loader crane</strong> is a hydraulically-powered articulated arm fitted to a truck or trailer, and is mainly used for loading or unloading of the vehicles.</p> <p><strong>Bulk-handling cranes</strong> are designed to carry a shell grab or bucket, rather than using a hook or a hoist.

A gantry crane is characterised by its flexibility. It is made out of a  <strong>basic frame, </strong>a <strong>cross beam</strong> and a <strong>trolley</strong>. The particularity of a portable gantry crane is that its frame can be driven along at least one axis. There are also mobile gantry cranes, like container trucks.</p>\r\n<p>Their basic frame contains four legs. These four mobile supports are connected by a cross beam. The supports and the cross beam are usually made out of steel profiles. The alternative is to use large box girders for the cross beam. With large gantry cranes, two of the supports are fixed and the other supports are connected by a slide bearing to the cross beam. Thereby, any changes in length due to fluctuating temperature are balanced out. A trolley is integrated onto the cross beam, which drives the component used to carry loads. The trolley contains a spool and a motor, to which the lifting cable, rope or chain is attached.</p>\r\n<h4>Characteristics of a Gantry Crane</h4>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_26319\" style=\"width: 700px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-26319\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/DEMAG-V-type-Gantry-Crane.jpg\" alt=\"DEMAG V type gantry crane can be used for a very heavy load\" width=\"700\" height=\"255\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">DEMAG V type gantry crane can be used for a very heavy load</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>A gantry crane’s 4-legged structure makes it particularly suited to move heavy loads over long distances. Revolving tower cranes can move loads within their working area. Thereby, they are dependent on the addition weight from the goods they are carrying. Revolving tower cranes are restricted in terms of how high they can lift very heavy loads, and this needs to be taken into account by the operator. However, these cranes always have their  <strong>centre of gravity in between their supporting legs</strong>. There is hardly any danger of the crane tipping over due to a load being wrongly lifted or stopped. However, this is only the case when the crane is correctly operated! Some of these cranes can support more than 40t!</p>\r\n<p>The disadvantage of a portal crane is that it requires  <strong>a lot of space</strong> and it has a very elaborate construction. It requires around four times as many machine elements as a tower crane. If a track-based system is also used, then the installation of a gantry crane becomes very demanding. A standard hoist is used for very demanding tasks, for example, when storing finished concrete workpieces, steel coils and slabs outdoors.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of Gantry Cranes</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7676\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7676 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/gantry_crane_honey_industry-300x167-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"Small gantry crane\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gantry cranes are also usable in an indoor industrial surroundings</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>The smallest and simplest portal crane is used in automobile workshops. They are  <strong>manually</strong> operated and are used to safely lift engines. Even with such small dimensions, they are known for their <strong>stability</strong>. There are hardly any medium-sized gantry type of cranes. For lifting operations in indoor industrial settings, <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/travelling-crane\">bridge cranes</a></strong> and overhead crane are used instead of portal cranes. Gantry cranes are mainly used outdoors. They can have enormous dimensions; heights of up to 30 metres are not rare. A special type of gantry crane is a loading truck for high sea containers. These trucks are fully mobile and can reach every point within a workspace, even if it is several thousand square metres large. Other special constructions include combined designs, where a tower crane is mounted into the carriage of a gantry crane. These types of cranes are called level luffing cranes and are mainly used to load ships.</p>\r\n<h4>Working with a Gantry Crane</h4>\r\n<p>Gantry cranes are manually operated using  <strong>remote control</strong> or with an <strong>integrated driver’s cab. </strong>Small gantry cranes that are used for workshops do not require any specific kind of qualification; basic training is sufficient. However, larger loading cranes can only be used by operators with a certificate. The TÜV offers this necessary training. The bigger the crane, the more delayed and cumbersome its reactions are to the controls. There would be a very high risk of danger for both humans and the machine, if a gantry crane, which carries incredibly heavy loads, were to be operated by any untrained or unskilled workers.  Particularly tricky loads are those that shake or vibrate when being moved. This occurs due when the acceleration and force goes beyond the loads own weight. If this occurs when the maximum weight is being carried, then the crane can be pushed over capacity. During training, a crane driver would learn how to react in such a situation and how to bring the load under control.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Used Gantry Cranes for Sale at Second Hand Market</h2>\r\n<p>Affordable <strong>gantry cranes for sale</strong> are not easy to find without having proper equipment dealer connections where you need to ring a lot of telephone numbers for the same. At TradeMachines, we try to make your life easy by collecting all the <strong>used gantry cranes for sale</strong> together from a vast and wide selection of auction houses, second hand market dealers and manufacturers under a single roof in which are available on our used travaling cranes category on our platform where you will be able to choose or bid and win a used <strong>gantry crane </strong> or even a used overhead crane for sale within few clicks online. </p>\r\n<h4>Maintenance of Used Gantry Cranes</h4>\r\n<p>Machine operated gantry cranes have to follow the machine guidelines. These, and the specific norms for cranes, regularly review the lifting units. When buying a used gantry crane, it is important to undertake a thorough inspection of the machine. Used gantry cranes are highly stressed constructions that have many <strong>points of wear and tear</strong>. These do not only include the moveable components, but also the whole structure of the used crane needs to be regularly checked for any weakness. Even though the movement of a gantry crane only runs in three axes, the adjustment of loads impacts the whole structure. This means that they require a lot of regular checks and maintenance.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_23893\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-23893\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/Demag-Gantry-Crane-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Demag Gantry Crane\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Demag Gantry Crane can support up to 40t</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h3>Suppliers of Gantry Cranes</h3>\r\n<p>Gantry cranes are special constructions that can be produced in accordance with customer requirements.

A <strong>typical area of operation </strong><strong>for this type of crane is around</strong><strong> production and machine tools that need to be loaded with heavy transport containers. </strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/saws\"><strong>Industrial saws</strong></a><strong> </strong>and cutting machines like water, plasma or flame cutters are commonly equipped with a jib crane. With their help, the delivered components can be easily placed on the work table and then taken away again after the process is complete. Free standing jib cranes are ideal for specific and reoccurring uses. Slewing jib cranes are <strong>most commonly used indoors. </strong>For outdoor operations, slewing jib cranes are often built to be large and powerful. An example of a portable jib crane design, which is decidedly built for outdoor use is the boat crane.</p>\r\n<h3>The Construction of a Jib Crane</h3>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_7856\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7856 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/jc-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Mounted Jib Crane\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jib cranes can be mounted on a wall or column</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>There are two types of jib cranes. <strong>Column-mounted slewing cranes </strong>consist of a stable foot, upon which an extended arm is mounted. There is a trolley on the extended arm, which hosts the lifting mechanism. A <strong>wall-mounted slewing jib crane </strong>does not have its own stand but it is directly mounted on a wall or a column. <br />Slewing jib cranes intended for indoor use are generally equipped with a horizontal cantilever arm and trolley. <strong>Luffing and derrick cranes, </strong>in the form of a slewing crane, are not overhead cranes. When used indoors, slewing cranes with a wide overhanging outer boom require a lot of space, which further restricts the crane's freedom of movement. Luffing and derrick cranes are also available as free standingjib cranes for outdoor use. You can find specific information through jib crane plans.</p>\r\n<h4>The Size of a Jib Crane</h4>\r\n<p>Revolving cranes have a counterweight, which is used to even out the torque that occurs when a load is lifted. <a href=\"//trademachines.com/gantry-crane\"><strong>Gantry and overhead cranes</strong></a><strong> </strong>are particularly stable because the distribution of the lifted loads are distributed over several different points of support. Both of these are not available for the crane jib. <strong>For this reason, their support and structural system is particularly massive</strong>. Slewing crane's columns and cantilever arms can be very large. These constructions allow this type of crane to lift very heavy loads. The stability of the cantilever arm is reached by using torsionally rigid double T beams, box profiles or welded triangular constructions. Jib crane components can be massive, but their construction is very simple. This means that if slewing cranes are bought used, they can be easily modified. The booms (particularly when used with a double T beams) can easily be shortened or switched out for a longer arm. The cranes that are most commonly installed in industrial halls are primarily made out of normal components, <strong>which can be easily ordered. </strong>For the particularly massive special cranes, the manufacturers can usually help to figure out how best fit the crane in its area of operation. The producers of jib cranes and jib crane parts usually have excellent customer service and also give good advice with regards to buying their used products.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Working with a Jib Crane &amp; Slewing Jib Crane</h2>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_7857\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7857 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/jc-2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"wall slewing cranes \" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jib cranes have motors that move the lifting trollys</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>The size of a jib crane, just like other <a href=\"//trademachines.com/gantry-crane\"><strong>cranes</strong></a>, determines how qualified the operator needs to be. Simple <strong>wall-mounted slewing cranes</strong> have an electric motor in the lifting unit. Therefore, pushing the trolley or moving the crane can be undertaken with muscle power. High-quality jib cranes are so well equipped, that they can still be manually adjusted, even with loads of over hundreds of kilogrammes.</p>\r\n<p>In sensitive areas or with loads of up to several tonnes, a <strong>portable</strong> <strong>crane has an engine</strong> that powers the trolley and the movement of the beam. These types of cranes are much more expensive than their simple, manually-operated counterparts. This is because these machines are only built with particularly high-quality components. A weight, weighing about a tonne, is located at the <strong>tip of the beam</strong>, which already gives the crane its torque momentum on the radial and axial bearings of the crane. As the crane turns, there is a further torque in a transverse direction. The applied forces multiply to enormous levels of pressure tension on the bearings and the <strong>slewing gear</strong>, which puts a strain on all the constructive components. The highest quality components are used so that this can be permanently and safely prevented from happening.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_24333\" style=\"width: 900px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-24333\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/DEMAG-free-standing-jib-cranej.jpg\" alt=\"DEMAG free standing jib cranej\" width=\"900\" height=\"328\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">There are many kinds the jib crans are used, like a free standing</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>Hall slewing jib cranes are general controlled via a <strong>cable or remote control. </strong>A crane operating license is required for this type of controlling system. Every operation, which uses this type of crane, needs to appoint safety officers or machines officers. They are trained to provide briefings and internal training on how to operate a truck jib crane. For training on how to operate a crane, there are associations that can provide training materials. With a bit of practice, it is possible to learn how to correctly work with a slewing crane in a few hours.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Outdoor cranes</strong><strong>, like loading or boat c</strong>ranes are controlled from their own <strong>driver's cab.</strong> Before operating these cranes, one must have an official crane operating license. The independent testing institutes usually have this type of training available.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_24334\" style=\"width: 500px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-24334\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/wall-mounted-slewing-crane-demag.jpg\" alt=\"wall-mounted slewing crane demag\" width=\"500\" height=\"264\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">If your business is always interchanging, also your equipment needs to be flexible, and change from free standing crane to a wall-mounted</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<h3>Accessories For Wall-mounted Slewing Crane And Free Standing Jib Cranes</h3>\r\n<p>Jib cranes can be equipped with all types of accessories. In addition to the common beams and chains, permanent or electromagnetic grippers and special lifting devices are available in jib crane kits such as a wall-mounting equipment or even special free standing accessories which makes it possible. <strong>Scales and sensors can be useful tools for receiving and sorting goods. </strong>If the crane has been optimally suited to fit the job crane specifications, then it is a economical and highly efficient tool.</p>\r\n<h2>Buying Used Jib Cranes</h2>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_7858\" style=\"width: 245px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7858 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/jc-3-245x300.jpg\" alt=\"column mounted slewing crane\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jib cranes are commonly used for lifting boats</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>Due to their simple construction, portable <strong>jib cranes can be bought used</strong>. The vertical column and the boom need to be completely straight. Aluminium measuring bars can be used to check this. Crooked, buckled or warped cranes should not be used. A bent boom suggests that the used portable jib crane for sale has been overloaded and this can impact all the crane's components. If the crane has been disassembled, then the bearings and bearing supports can no longer be noise and backlash free. Therefore, damaged cranes should not be used and should be recycled.</p>\r\n<p>A <strong>used jib crane</strong> should always have a certification label from an independent monitoring organisation. <strong>One should be cautious with freshly painted used cranes</strong>. If the <strong>jib crane for sale</strong> has been repaired using welding, this can often no longer be seen under the paint. If these repairs were not undertaken correctly, there is a large risk that the crane could break. Therefore, a good crane with strong indications that it has been used is better than one that has been freshly painted. You can find many different used jib cranes for sale on TradeMachines, including for instance <strong>portable jib crane</strong> or mobile jib crane, small jib crane, floor mounted jib crane, hydraulic jib crane and telescopic jib crane.

These can also be called an “underslung crane” or a “bridge crane”. The name is based on the structure of the crane: <strong>it looks like a bridge</strong>. Two stable constructions are found on either side of the workspace, and the cross beam upon which the crane travels is connected by the two side structures. A <strong>Goliath or</strong> <a href=\"//trademachines.com/portalkran\"><strong>gantry crane</strong></a> is very similar to a bridge crane, but they stand on supports containing wheels. With bridge cranes, the cross beam lies directly on the crane runway.</p>\r\n<h3>Bridge / Overhead Crane Safty</h3>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7689\" style=\"width: 290px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7689\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/oc-1-300x163.jpg\" alt=\"port crane\" width=\"290\" height=\"157\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Overhead cranes can be used outdoors and indoors</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>A bridge crane<strong> requires a stable track</strong>. These are most commonly projected out from the concrete masonry. However, it is not a big problem if this design is not used, as a workspace can be equipped with this type of crane using simple steel beams. The crane runway usually runs along the length of the hall, which depicts the x-axis of the working space of the crane. The overhead crane has a really simple structure. One or two bridge elements span over the intended crane runway, which is where the trolley is. A lifting device is connected to the trolley. The direction of the bridge and the trolley’s runway depicts the y-axis of the bridge crane. This is usually the width of the hall. The direction in which the load is lifted is determined by the pull of the trolley. This is the z-axis of the crane. This means that all areas within a hall could be reached. Just like gantry cranes, bridge cranes are characterised by the fact that they move their loads within their focus areas. <strong>Thereby, they are very safe and do not cause any damage to the load</strong>. The safety of overhead cranes makes them ideal for many uses. Tower cranes, on the other hand, could fall over if they are overloaded. The bridge crane also doesn’t take up any space within a workspace; it is not in the way, when not being used.</p>\r\n<h4>Working with an Overhead Crane</h4>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7694\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7694 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/oc-2-300x167.png\" alt=\"Overhead Bridge Crane\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some overhead cranes have driver cabs for operating</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>This type of crane is operated by driver cabs, cables or remote control. Operators should have completed at least one in-house training day with the crane before operating it independently. The basic operating principles can be learned very quickly but there is a lot to learn in terms of the necessary precautions for safely operating a crane. <strong>It is very important to practice moving goods quietly and without vibration</strong>. It is particularly important to learn which goods can be carried and which cannot. Most accidents with cranes occur because of limited knowledge in this area. For example, cylinder trolleys for blow torches or welding equipment can only be lifted with specially customised lifting devices. Even though it seems simple, working with a crane cannot be underestimated.</p>\r\n<h4>Sheet Lifters used with Overhead Crane</h4>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_27380\" style=\"width: 408px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-27380\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/sheet-lifters-in-action.jpg\" alt=\"sheet lifter crane in action\" width=\"408\" height=\"241\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sheet lifter crane in action</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>One of the popular types of overhead crane uses is the sheet lifters, a crane attachment that specialised in lifting metal sheets or any other material sheets. This specific type of crane, the sheet lifters can be attached to almost every overhead crane or bridge crane out there. </p>\r\n<h4>Maintaining an Overhead Crane</h4>\r\n<p>A bridge crane is a heavy-duty piece of equipment, which is exposed to very high levels of wear and tear along its whole structure. This is particularly the case with the heavy components such as slabs, coils or steel pipes. <strong>A regular, or at least annual, check up is required for the operation of the crane</strong>. Due to its simple construction, the crane can be repaired with relatively few resources. Depending on the circumstances, many components have a limited working lifespan. This is particularly the case for the lifting equipment, like the rope and stops. When buying a second-hand bridge crane for sale, it is important to make sure that these components are well documented. If not, they should be exchanged. It is also important to look for visible damages when buying a used crane. For example, if the cross-beams are crooked, these cannot be used. Maintenance work must be undertaken by professional maintenance technicians. Cranes have special lubrication points then need to be regularly tended to. The working lifespan of the crane will significantly increase if this is done regularly and correctly.</p>\r\n<h3>Used Overhead Cranes for Sale</h3>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7696\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7696 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/oc-3-300x170.png\" alt=\"overhead crane\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Find the best used overhead cranes in online auctions</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>It is becoming easier to find <strong>Used Overhead Cranes</strong> which suits your business requirements and that complies with your budget.

Every type of forklift has specific advantages and disadvantages. Electric forklifts are very quiet and emission-free. Therefore, they are the best type of forklift for indoor transportation. Forklifts with a diesel engine are very economical and are characterised as being able to generate high levels of power without consuming very much energy, but they are not suitable for indoor use. </span></p>\r\n<p><b>LPG forklifts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are just as quiet as electric forklifts, and also have clean combustion, meaning that they can be used in enclosed rooms. This is possible because of the modern engine management system and the use of a clean propane gas as a fuel. However, carbon dioxide emissions can never be avoided when it comes to using a combustion engine. Propane gas is a fossil fuel, built upon carbon fuel, which when oxidised turns into the desired fuel. When using LPG forklifts indoors, it is highly recommended to have an effective exhaust system. </span></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33628 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/lpg-forklift-1-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"LPG forklift\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The structure of an LPG forklift</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An LPG forklift consists of a slightly tilted lifting device with </span><b>an attached fork</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, an engine, two axles with wheels, a driver's seat and a counterweight. Just like all forklifts, LPG forklifts are also steered by their back wheels. This means that they have a </span><b>very tight turning circle</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and are </span><b>easy to manoeuvre</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in small spaces. A stable driver's cab with a roll-over protection system protects the driver from being buried by the forklift if it tips over. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To refuel an LPG forklift, </span><b>the propane gas</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> tank has to be switched. This requires a large screw key. The propane gas tank is often installed at the rear of the vehicle. It is either attached with belts or a clamping system, which is easy to open. With some practice, a propane gas tank can be switched in less than two minutes. </span></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33629 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/lpg-gas-forklift-300x151.jpg\" alt=\"propane forklift\" width=\"300\" height=\"151\" /></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leading propane forklift manufacturers and their models</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the table below, you can find some of the </span><b>leading manufacturers</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of propane forklifts and their most popular models.

It has a regular boom with the bucket facing the driver’s cab. The cab which is attached to <strong>the boom is able to rotate 360 degrees</strong> allowing for digging anywhere around the loader excavator. The placement of the bucket allows the driver to dig up soil towards the <strong>backhoe</strong> and it also gives a good view to the driver of the movement of the bucket. The backhoe bucket can also be replaced with powered attachments such as a breaker, grapple, auger, or a stump grinder. Many backhoes feature quick attach mounting systems and auxiliary hydraulic circuits for simplified attachment mounting and retracting.</p><figure id=\"attachment_7379\" style=\"width: 307px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7379\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/BH-3-300x125.jpg\" alt=\"Backhoe with tracks\" width=\"307\" height=\"128\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crawler backhoe on its way to work</figcaption></figure> <h2>Used Backhoe for Sale</h2> <p>On TradeMachines, numerous<strong> used backhoes for sale </strong>are displayed which are hosted by leading auction houses.

A regular excavator would comprise of hydraulic cylinders, a boom, an arm and a bucket. All these components work together to make the excavator functional without much of disruptions. Adjusting the levels of oil in the hydraulic cylinders could greatly affect the accuracy of the hydraulic excavator. <strong>Hydraulic excavators have largely replaced the cable excavators</strong> which are mammoth earth moving machines which function with the help of cables and ropes. Cable excavators were once used in the mining and construction industries for excavation purposes. The major reasons for replacement of cable excavators by hydraulic excavators can be cited as cheaper costs, faster mobility and easier operation.</p>\r\n<h2>Hydraulic Excavators : Components &amp; Build</h2>\r\n<p>The different components which make up the hydraulic excavator and the operational features of the individual components are explained below:</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_9487\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-9487\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/he-1-300x147.jpg\" alt=\"hydraulic excavator arm\" width=\"300\" height=\"147\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arm of the hydraulic excavator is moving in two parts</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p><strong>Arm</strong> - The hydraulic excavator operates on different levels. The first is the arm of the vehicle. The arm is comprised of two hydraulic cylinders, a bucket and a boom, which is on the upper part of the arm. The arm of the hydraulic excavator is <strong>analogous to the human arm</strong> <strong>and moves in two parts</strong>: at the wrist and the elbow. Inside of the hydraulic cylinder is a rod, which constitute the inner part of the cylinder, and a piston, which is at the end of the cylinder and enabling the arm to move with the help of oil. If there were no oil in the cylinder, the piston would drop to the bottom, but because of the nature of oil, its volume always stays the same. Oil is pumped through the end of the piston and in turn pushes the rod through the cylinder, thus creating movement of one or both parts of the arm. By controlling the amount of oil is pumped through the valve, the accuracy of the arm can be easily manipulated. This movement is activated by the use of control valves that are positioned inside the cab where the driver seat is located.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Engine</strong> - Power in an automobile is normally received straight from the engine but it works differently in a hydraulic excavator. Because the machine uses a lot of force, it is <strong>able to move by changing the energy it receives from the engine into hydraulic power</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Swing</strong> - One of the functions of this machine is its <strong>ability to turn</strong>. The swing of the excavator enables it to achieve the turn. The swing circle comprises of several sub-components such as an outer race, an inner race, ball bearings and a pinion. As the outer race turns, the pinion runs alongside the unmoving inner race. The ball bearings work to ensure that this is done smoothly.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_9485\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-9485\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/he-2-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"Hydraulic crawler excavator\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hydraulic crawler excavator at construction site</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p><strong>Cab</strong> - The third part of the hydraulic excavator is the upper structure <strong>where the driver’s seat is located and the controls are positioned</strong>.

There are two types of excavator bases based on which the excavators can be broadly classified.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of Hydraulic Excavators</h2>\r\n<p>The two major types of hydraulic excavators used for industrial purposes are: <strong>crawler excavators and wheel excavators</strong>.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Crawler excavators</strong> - These are the main excavators widely available in the market. They are usually very big and very large and they always come with very high horsepower. <strong>Crawler excavator runs on two endless tracks (chain wheel system).</strong> These types of excavators are predominantly used in hilly areas where risks of sliding of machinery are on the verge. Crawler type excavator has low ground pressure because of spreading of load on large area. Therefore, it is also used where soil support is weak.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_9490\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9490 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/he-3-300x176.jpg\" alt=\"Hydraulic wheel excavator\" width=\"300\" height=\"176\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hydraulic wheel excavator in a company</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify\">\r\n<p><strong>Wheel excavators</strong> - Wheel excavator runs on wheels and are used <strong>for excavation and loading of dump trucks</strong> and most of the time it is only used for plain ground operations. Because of wheel, it is not suitable for hilly areas due to low grip value to the ground. Majority of the excavators run on continuous tracks rather than on wheels, because it is easier to manoeuvre them on a track.

As the mobile excavator is mounted on simple tyres or twin tyres, in most cases the stability of the mobile excavators is not enough to secure maximum safety. In order to increase the safety level of the mobile excavators, most wheeled excavators are equipped with at least a hydraulic support blade or two hydraulic outriggers. <strong>For rough grounds, they can be equipped as well with four outriggers or a combination of a blade and two outriggers.</strong> Though it is less flexible than the crawler excavators which can run on worse road condition or a little swampy pavement, it is still widely utilized in many fields.

precision. They can be used before planting, to aerate the soil as it is a <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/soil-preparation-equipment\">soil preparation equipment</a></strong>, or after your crop is already growing. The carefully designed pattern of the cultivator allows you to kill the weeds without disrupting the crop. There are manual cultivators as well as mechanical field cultivators on the market.</p> <h2>Top Manufacturers of Cultivators</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_7654\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7654 size-full\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/Clv-1.jpg\" alt=\"pulverized soil \" width=\"300\" height=\"153\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Before planting cultivators prepare the soil</figcaption></figure> <p>Manual field cultivators allow the average gardener to make light work of a big job. The most popular brands of hand-held cultivators are TROY-BUILT, HONDA, BLACK&amp;DECKER, MANTIS, CUB CADET, EARTHQUAKE, EARTHWISE, and GREENWORKS. Manual cultivators are available in either electric or gas models, which should be something that is carefully considered before buying a used cultivator. The operator will have a greater range of use with a gas cultivator versus an electric-corded cultivator. <strong>Mechanical cultivators</strong> are typically attached to a tractor and pulled through the field. They allow a large area of field to be worked in a short amount of time, while still giving the user a controlled digging pattern. There are many popular brands including JOHN DEERE, CASE IH, KRAUSE, INTERNATIONAL, GLENCOE, and MISC to name a few. </p> <h2>Looking for Used Cultivators?</h2> <p>If your firm needs to stock up on<a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\"><strong> farm equipment for sale</strong></a>, the TradeMachines auction site features a <strong>huge selection of field cultivators for sale</strong> from sellers located across the world. We bring together sellers of agricultural and industrial equipment, allowing anyone looking for harrows, cultivators, combine harvesters or tractors to find whatever they are looking for at the lowest possible price.

If you are cultivating potatoes, arable crops, fodder crops or simply managing a stretch of grass, you will find used cultivators on the TradeMachines website that will fill the gap in your machinery portfolio.

Every major brand of cultivators for sale will be found on the TradeMachines auction portal. From Greenworks to Remington, and from Ryobi to Black and Decker, every type and make of cultivator will be available from a seller located in your region.</p> <h2>Advantages of Buying a Used Cultivator</h2> <p>The first and most obvious reason for <strong>buying a used cultivator is to save money</strong>. Most brand new cultivators, especially the heavy-duty or mechanical cultivators, will come with a hefty price tag and they are only used seasonally. <strong>Cultivator auctions</strong> are a great way to get the best price and still bring home your ideal choice of cultivator brand or style. Cultivator auctions are also a great way to check out the market and see what you can afford buying a used cultivator versus a new one. </p> <h2>Manufacturers of Cultivators</h2> <p>Some of the well

they can improve crop yields and productivity easily and with minimal effort. Below you will find a detailed overview of the seed drills currently available in the market.</p> <h2>About seed drills</h2> <p>Seed drills are a type of <a href=\"//trademachines.com/seedingdrilling-epuipment\"><strong><span>seed sowing </span>machine</strong></a> used on agricultural crops. Seed drills are usually being towed by a <a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\"><strong>used tracto</strong></a>r.These machines were created with the objective of delivering an improved and more even seed distribution, therefore reducing the amount of seeds wasted and reducing the chances of over-<strong>seeding a field</strong>. In addition, the mechanics behind seed drills result in better germination rates and give farmers more control over the sowing process. <strong>Overall, seed drills can be considered a productivity tool that aids increase efficiency, reduce waste, and implement cost-effective agricultural production methods</strong>. Seed drills are usually being towed by a used tractor.</p> <h2>Types of Seed Drills</h2> <p>Seed drills can be classified according to their capacity and functioning mechanism. In terms of the mechanisms available, farmers can choose between:</p> <p>- No till seed drill units, which allow them to sow on pretty much every soil type, including those that have not been previously prepared.</p> <p>- Pneumatic seed drill devices, which are designed to easily cover large areas, as they have working widths of between 4 and 7 metres.</p> <p>- <a href=\"//trademachines.com/precision-air-seeders\"><strong>Precision seed drill units</strong></a>, which come in handy when working on crops that need individual seed planting. These machines can be easily configured to adjust the distance between rows milimetrically to suit specific crop requirements to perfection.</p> <p>- Zero till seed drill units are especially suited to areas where water is scarce and can result in yield increases of up to 7 per cent. Zero till drills are also highly cost-efficient, as they consume little fuel.</p> <p>In terms of their capacity, small seed drill units (sometimes labelled <strong>ATV seed drill</strong> or <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/compact-tractors\">compact tractor</a></strong> seed drill units) usually have a hopper capacity that ranges between 400 and 1,000 litres. Hand seed drill units also fall under this category. At the other end of the scale, seed drills that have working widths of between 6 and 15 metres and higher yield a high acreage output.</p> <h2>Things to look for in a seed drill machine</h2> <p>When choosing a drill seeder, it is important to look for things like the quality and robustness of <strong>seed drill parts</strong>, especially if you are after a used seed drill for sale. Other things to look for in both new and used seed drill machines are the hopper's capacity, and whether they incorporate a towable fertilizer spreader. Farmers may also want to consider looking into seed drills for specific purposes, such as<strong> grass seed drill units</strong> (sometimes called grass seeder drill machines), which ensure that grass and clover seeds are planted at the right depth (no deeper than 1cm).</p> <h2>Who Manufacture Seed Drill For Sale?</h2> <p>Reputable seed drill manufacturers include<strong> Dale Drills</strong> (which have a great seed drill for sale selection, including zero till and small seed drill for sale), <strong>Jordan Engineering</strong> (specialists in lightweight, compact drills, and small seed drill for sale), and <strong>Becker</strong> (manufacturers of precision and large-capacity drills). Those looking for a modern and cost-efficient grass seed drill for sale may want to contact <strong>Kongskilde</strong>. Other reputable manufacturers include <strong>RECO</strong>, <strong>Stanhay</strong>, <strong>Gaspardo</strong>, <strong>SeedMaster</strong>, <strong>Vaderstad</strong>, <strong>P&amp;F Services</strong>, <strong>Lemken</strong>, <strong>Amazone</strong>-<strong>Werke</strong>, and <strong>Horsch</strong>.</p></p>"},{"id":"1574_en","content":"<p><p><b>Other products in

machinery</a></strong> implements used for <strong>breaking up residues, uprooting of weeds, coverings seeds and smoothening of the soil surface</strong>. Harrows, including grass harrows and drag harrows, are of different types. The most common ones are: disc harrows, <a href=\"//trademachines.com/chain-harrows\"><strong>chain harrows</strong></a>, tine harrows, spike type harrows and spring type harrows. <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/disc-harrows\">Used Disc harrows</a> are better than the other conventional types of harrows in pulverising the soil</strong> but at the same time they also require more power input. There are also powered harrows which are single pass secondary tillage tools mounted on tractors and uses the power from the tractor’s Power Take off (PTO) to drive the harrow tines in a reciprocating or rotary manner. The power harrows have nowadays replaced the separate operations performed by the disc, spring and spike type harrows. The power harrows can also be sub-divided into four types as: reciprocating, spike rotary, semi-rotary and <a href=\"//trademachines.com/rotary-harrows\"><strong>rotary harrows</strong></a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Models of Harrows from VICON</h2>\r\n<p>VICON, one of the <strong>leading innovators in the field of agricultural equipment manufacturing</strong> offers a number of <strong>power harrows for sale</strong>. VICON Rau Toptiller TT 15, VICON Rau Toptiller TT 18, VICON Rau Toptiller TT 25, VICON Rau Toptiller TT-F20 and VICON Rau Toptiller TT-F35 are the five variants which come under the category of power harrows from VICON. VICON Rau Toptiller TT 15 is specifically designed for small sized farms and tractors up to 140 hp while VICON Rau Toptiller TT-F35 is the strongest among the five models and is suitable for tractors up to 350 hp.</p>\r\n<h2>Used Harrows for Sale</h2>\r\n<p>A <strong>used harrow for sale</strong> can be bought through online auctions easily when compared to buying through traditional methods.

<strong>examine</strong> chemical, physical, biological, medical and technical objects, and their interactions. They are also used to undertake <strong>production processes</strong> in controlled environments. Laboratory technology, like apparatuses, machines, devices, tools and materials, require a high level of <strong>quality and cleanliness</strong>. The type of technology used depends on the ultimate goal of the laboratory. The equipment used in chemical and biological laboratories is commonly made out of glass because it is inert, heat resistant and easy to clean. Additionally, chemical and physical processes are easily observed when undertaken behind glass. The disadvantage of using hard glass material for chemical processes is that it is very brittle.</p> <h2>Special requirements for the measuring technology used in laboratories</h2> <p>Accuracy is of great importance and can only be ensured when using particularly precise and sensitive measuring equipment. This provides defined and constant <strong>environmental conditions</strong>. Humidity can, for example, influence weights of around a microgram. Thermal expansion and other influences on the measuring equipment itself need to be prevented. A suitable exhaust system is required when working with materials that potentially create toxic gases or steam. The extracted air then also needs to be cleaned using an additional system. Therefore, laboratory technology also includes <strong>ventilation and air conditioning equipment</strong>. This equipment aids work processes that are easily affected by contaminated air, for example, when manufacturing semiconductors or solid state physics. Containers and apparatuses also need to be particularly clean and laboratories often use ultrasonic baths to clean these materials. Even though the situation is different in a physics laboratory, it is still important that highly accurate measuring equipment is used in controlled environments.</p> <h2>Where is laboratory technology used?</h2> <p>It is applied for <strong>research, teaching and production</strong>. Simple chemical and physics laboratories can be found in schools. The amount of photography laboratories has decreased in recent times, but despite the development of digital photography, they are still commonly used. High quality prints can be produced from digital photos if printed on real photographic paper. There is an advantage to using chemical photographic materials in artistic and school settings. The technology required for photography mainly consists of components that are specially designed for this purpose. However, there are also overlaps with general chemical laboratory technology: the tools used to produce the ready-made solutions for photographic chemicals; and the accurate thermometer, suited for chemicals, with a resolution of at least a half of a degree. In universities and high schools, laboratories are required for both teaching and for research. This is determined by the quality of the technology, as well as other standards. The medical industry uses a laboratory for <strong>research, diagnoses and for production</strong> (e.g. dental veneers or dentures). Laboratory technology is used in industry and in the commercial setting for specific production processes and research. For example, the operation of a precise CNC jig boring machine demands highly precise measuring equipment, and it has high standards for the conditions of its surroundings.</p> <h2>Who produces laboratory technology?</h2> <p>Some of the companies that produce and supply machines and accessories for various types of laboratory include BRIMON, BÜCHI, DUNN, HERMLE, HÄBERLE, IKA, JULABO, KABE, KLEINFELD, MAYTEC, SÜSSE, WINDAUS and WITEG.</p>"},{"id":"1599_en","content":""},{"id":"1596_en","content":"<h2><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15148\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/bread.jpg\" alt=\"food proccesing industry\" width=\"1600\" height=\"229\" /></h2>\r\n<h2>Industrial Food Processing Machinery</h2>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_15155\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15155\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/vintage-food-processing-machinery-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage food processing machinery\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vintage food processing machinery</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>Nowadays, a large variety of food products are processed and prepared. This increases their shelf life and reduces the time needed to prepare dishes. In order to still ensure long shelf lives and the best possible preparation of food, these products need to be produced with great care. Therefore, the highest priority for food processing is<br /> <strong>hygiene</strong>! Irrespective of which food processing technology or machine is being used, all machines in the food industry need to be <strong>rust and emissions-free, can be easily disassembled and are fully sterilised</strong>. Machines in this industry are most commonly made out of rust-free stainless steel. This material does not corrode, it has the required stability and it does not need to be additionally coated. Stainless steel is most suited for very high temperatures, it can be cleaned with very hard or sharp cleaning utensils, and it can be recycled again and again. This means that these types of machines for the food industry are the most expensive on the market.</p>\r\n<h2>The Steps of Food Processing Equipment</h2>\r\n<p>The first step in food <strong>processing</strong>  equipment is <strong>cleaning</strong> the input product. Whether it is apples, carrots, fish or other crops, cleaning the foodstuffs is always the first stage. There are a large variety of cleaning machines available on the market. Simple machines consist of a <a href=\"//trademachines.com/transportbaender\"><strong>conveyor belt</strong></a>, upon which the food products are led through the process. High pressure nozzles are used to ensure that all dirt particles are removed. High-end machines are <strong>constructed to suit each individual pre-product</strong>. After cleaning, the pre-product is then further <strong>prepared</strong>. Fruits are cored, peels are removed and undesired components of meat products are removed. Unlike industrially produced products, fruit, nuts and vegetables are not standardised, which makes the demand for manual labour very high when working with these products. The tools used also count as part of the machines for the food industry. After the pre-products are cleaned and the undesired parts have been removed, they are <strong>portioned</strong>. This work can be undertaken by a wide range of <strong>fully automatic cutting machines</strong>. This includes, among others, machines used to cut the pre-products into strips or cubes, and grinders used to make spreads and creams. After the products are cut into portions, they are sent to be mixed. <strong>Mixing machines</strong> can be used to prepare a large number of foodstuffs ranging from pizza toppings to stews. Depending on the type of food, the mixing machine is either equipped with a <strong>baking, cooking or sterilisation machine</strong>.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_15157\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15157\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/Special-cookie-line-300x191.jpg\" alt=\"used food processing equipment\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Special production line machinery for cookies</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>The combination stage follows the mixing and cooking steps of the finished food products. This is where the various foodstuffs are put together, that cannot be prepared at the same time. For example, pizza toppings are first baked before they can be placed onto the base. These machines are made out of a number of <strong>conveyor belts</strong> and positioning systems which put the various components together into a finished product. The structure of the machine can vary greatly, depending on the product. There are a lot of possibilities for the combination step of finished products, from a fully automatic process to solely manual processing. One or more work steps always comes after this step, to prepare the final product. After the combination and finishing stages, the final product is packaged. Disposable packaging is most commonly used for this purpose, with exception of some beverages. Disposable packaging is always sterilised. The demand of cleaning reusable products is not proportional to the production costs for disposable packaging.<br /> <strong>Reusable packaging</strong> is very robust, to ensure that it can be reused. In order to ensure sustainable consumption of materials, a piece of plastic packaging that is used 20 times cannot weigh 20 times that of foil packaging. However, this type of packaging also requires 20 times higher transportation costs, which cancels out the savings. Therefore, disposable packaging will remain an industry standard for a long time. Deep freeze products are frozen after they are packaged. There are several advantages to freezing products, including that less preservatives are required. Depending on the product, some chemical preservatives can be completely avoided. For frozen ready meals, the greatest level of preparation has already been undertaken in the factory. Customers just need to heat the food up and then it is ready for consumption. The ideal<br /> <strong>preservation</strong> <strong>method</strong> for fresh crops is deep freezing. <strong>Rapid freezing</strong> ensures that pees, beans, strawberries and cabbage retain their vitamins. This means that the vegetables are as digestible and as rich as if they were freshly bought at the weekly market.<br /> The industry has a large variety of machines ranging from<br /> <strong>wash systems</strong>, <strong>stirrers</strong>, <strong>sterilisation units,</strong> <strong>baking</strong> and <strong>cooking</strong> <strong>stations</strong>, <strong>minimising</strong> <strong>machines</strong>, <strong>portioners</strong>, <strong>packaging</strong> <strong>machines</strong> and <strong>deep</strong> <strong>freezers</strong>. There is a very wide selection of suitable machines.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_15160\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15160\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/Big-Machine-300x184.jpg\" alt=\"food processing machines\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Special machine for the world's favorite food - Fries</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<h2>Buying Used Food Processing Equipment</h2>\r\n<p>The biggest enemy of industrial food production is dirt. This does not only include waste material from the production process, but also paint particles, metal debris, lubricants, cleaning products and other undesired dirt. If the dirt is only first discovered by the customer, this can have dramatic consequences. Food production factories are regularly monitored and often have unannounced visits from the authorities. Unauthorised dirt can quickly lead to the whole factory being shut down. The demanding task of monitoring all potential sources of dirt is thereby the highest priority of machine operators in the food industry. Due to this, second-hand machines are usually in <strong>excellent condition</strong>. However, they should be thoroughly examined before bought. There are companies that are specialized in repairing machines used for food processing products. These companies are able to repair almost any machine. However, it is very important to see a machine’s legal documents before buying it. Many processes that were used in the past are no longer used today. The health authorities will be able to issue valid information about this topic.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_15151\" style=\"width: 298px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-15151 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/mixer-298x300.jpg\" alt=\"mixer\" width=\"298\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Industrial bakery mixer</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<h2>Working With Food Processing Machines</h2>\r\n<p>What ever is important for the food processing technology is also important for the employees. Hygiene is of the highest priority when handling food products. In addition to basic briefing and training, wearing the right work clothes is particularly important for workers.<br /> <strong>Hair nets</strong>, <strong>mouth guards</strong>, <strong>gloves</strong> and <strong>aprons</strong> are standard items of clothing required when working with food products. Even the mechanic needs to be properly trained for their reparation and maintenance work, to ensure that no work materials end up in the production process.</p>\r\n<h2>Suppliers of machines for the food industry</h2>\r\n<p><strong> DORNOW</strong> and <strong>HERBORT</strong> provide a wide range of interesting machines for cleaning and preparing crops. <strong>AK</strong> <strong>NORD</strong>, <strong>GLASS</strong> and <strong>RUEHLE-HIGHTECH</strong> are recommended suppliers of machines for cutting and portioning. Preparation and sterilisation machines are available from <strong>WALDNER</strong>, <strong>BERIEF</strong> and <strong>GeBa Maschinenbau</strong>.</p>\r\n"},{"id":"1602_en","content":"<h2>How is power generation understood?</h2> <p>Power generation has to do with the generation of <strong>electrical power</strong>, and sometimes other forms of power, out of primary energy sources. The term is technically not correct, because the process includes transforming energy between different forms, rather than actually generating it. Generally, the definition is understood. It occurs most commonly in <strong>large technical</strong> systems called <strong>power plants</strong>.</p> <h2>Generating energy away from power plants</h2> <p>Smaller systems are used to: provide <strong>mobile power generators</strong> that have a high demand for energy; as an <strong>emergency power supply</strong> to ensure security in energy supply; and in the <strong>renewable energy</strong> sector. Mobile power generator systems and emergency power generators usually consist of a combustion engine with an attached generator. When energy demand is very high, diesel motors are used. Smaller systems ranging from 1 to 2 kW include with an Otto engine. Additionally, there are also very small power generators, with less than 1 kW of power. These have two-stroke engines.</p> <h2>Conventional Power Generators</h2> <p>Power generation from <strong> fossil fuels</strong> and<strong> nuclear power</strong> is a process that has several stages, in which the primary energy is first transformed into heat and then into mechanical energy. The desired form of electrical energy is then created within the <strong>generator</strong>. In order to increase the utilisation of primary energy, the inevitable losses in energy that occur in the form of waste heat can be used be used in suitable facilities as heat. This will increase the overall efficiency of these machines. However, a combined heat and power unit can also be used in order to increase the efficiency of producing heat energy. Combined heat and power is usually applied on a large scale with power plants that are connected to district heating networks. Large power plants generally require longer transportation routes and bigger networks to distribute district heating. This restricts the areas of application for combined heat and power systems in this sector. To avoid these disadvantages, smaller block heating stations can be installed closer to the consumer. Particularly small machines can also be built with motors from the car manufacturing sector. They are usually suited, for example, to supply single or multi-family houses. With these power generating machines, heat is the desired form of energy and the electrical energy is just a high-end side product.</p> <h2>Generating power from renewable sources</h2> <p>Contrary to conventional power plants, the <strong>conversion of energy</strong> occurs in a small, <strong>direct way</strong>, even in most large-scale renewable power plants. Hydroelectric power stations and wind turbines generate electricity directly from the <strong>energy of movement</strong>. In photovoltaic cells, the energy from the suns rays is transformed into electrical energy through solar panels and geothermal systems. A direct transformation of energy also occurs with heat pumps.<strong> Thermal energy</strong> is brought from one temperature level to another. For a heat pump, the inputted energy in the form of liquid or gaseous fuels is required for the maintenance of the process cycle. This is particularly important when using heat pumps for generating cold air for cooling units (e.g. household refrigerators).</p> <h2>Important milestones during the development of power generators</h2> <p>The history of power generation is tightly connected with the development of industry and is characterised in several large chunks. Until the 1970s, there was a direct relationship between the development of the economy and the consumption of energy. The oil crisis in 1973-1974 moved the focus towards energy saving and this resulted in the discovery that the economy could grow without energy consumption rising. At the end of the 20th century the <strong> limit of fossil fuels</strong> became known. This was particularly relevant for oil, which is an important resource for the chemical industry and many other aspects of everyday life. The influence of the industrialisation’s massive consumption of fossil fuels on the environment and climate, resulted in a need to change the way power is generated. Even <strong>nuclear power generators</strong> are not been identified as the ideal alternative to fossil fuels, due to the inherent problems associated with it. In the lead up to the third millennium, rising energy prices, technical challenges, motivations made through environmental policy and governmental subsidies in many countries has increased competitiveness in generating power from renewable sources.</p> <h2>Where are systems used for power generation?</h2> <p>Large power plants are operated by a few utility companies that work over several regions. Medium sized systems are available in industry and at a municipal level, for the <strong>regional supply</strong> in the case of e.g. public-owned utility companies. Subsidies from the government are available to install and operate systems that generate power from renewable sources. These are used in all sectors and by large utility companies and individual consumers. <strong>Wind energy</strong> provides an income stream for utility companies and for farmers, who could tap into this new source of income by generating power. In the private sector, power generation usually occurs through use of <strong>photovoltaics</strong>, <strong>thermal</strong> power from solar energy and <strong>combined heat and power</strong>. Additionally, heat pumps are used for geothermal energy, ambient heat and to increase the efficiency of solar thermal systems. The profits from combined heat and power units can be increased by installing heat storage tanks, which can be accessed at times of high levels of consumption.</p> <h2>Who Produces Power Generators?</h2> <p>Examples of companies that produce power generators include <strong>ALSTOM</strong>, <strong>AREVA, AVANTIS, BOSCH, SIEMENS, STIEBEL ELTRON, GENERAL ELECTRIC, MITSUBISHI HEAVY INDUSTRIES, VESTAS, NORDEX, REPOWER, SOLARWORLD, SOLON, SCHÜCO, ENERCON</strong> and <strong>VW</strong>.</p>"},{"id":"1595_en","content":"<p></p> <h3>Plastics Processing Process</h3> <p>Because of the properties of polymers, it is possible to mould them and modify their shape using different manufacturing processes collectively termed as Plastic processing. Plastics processing is a  <strong>form conversion process</strong>. Plastic raw materials in the form of</p> <p>powder, pellets, beads are heated, melted and then transformed into usable plastic products through plastic processing equipment and tooling. Over the past century, plastic processing has evolved from crude equipment, in which melting and forming of material was a strenuous task to the present microprocessor controlled plastic processing equipment. A well-maintained processing machine can easily last for at least  <strong>20 years</strong>. This is the reason for the growing trend towards buying <strong>used plastic processing equipment</strong>.</p> <h3>Types of Plastics Processing</h3> <p><strong>Moulding and extrusion</strong> are the two common processing methods for <strong>Thermoplastic resins</strong>. Moulding involves non-continuous processes such as injection moulding, blow moulding, rotational moulding, and compression moulding, in which parts are made in a closed mould. In extrusion, the plastic pellets are melted by a screw conveying system and forced to flow through a die. Calendering, thermoforming and casting are other operations through which thermoplastics can be processed. Generally used processing methods for <strong>thermosetting plastics</strong> are <strong>compression moulding, transfer moulding, and injection moulding</strong>. Fiber-reinforced thermosets are fabricated by specialised techniques namely open-mould processing, protrusion and reaction injection moulding.</p> <h4><strong>Extrusion</strong></h4> <p>Extrusion is a process in which plastic pellets are fed into a heated cylinder where it is driven by rotating screws compacting and squeezing it through a die to give a finished or semi-finished product with the desired profile.</p> <h4><strong>Blow Moulding</strong></h4> <p>Blow moulding is a simple process where compressed air is introduced underneath a pre-heated sheet of thermoplastic material forcing the material into a mould cavity, or allowing it to expand freely.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_27371\" style=\"width: 716px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-27371\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/Plastics-processig-machines.jpg\" alt=\"Plastics processig machines\" width=\"716\" height=\"404\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plastics processig machines</figcaption></figure> <h4><strong>The reforming</strong></h4> <p>It is basically the opposite of Blow moulding. Instead of the plastic sheet being forced into a mould by air pressure, in vacuum forming the air is drawn out from the bottom of the softened plastic sheet, so it is forced over or into a mould by atmospheric pressure.</p> <h4><strong>Extrusion Blow Moulding</strong></h4> <p>It is a combination of extrusion and blow moulding and is often used when there is a sudden change in thickness of the product such as the presence of a narrow neck. The plastic material is first extruded into a tube shape into an open die. The die is then closed to seal the ends of the tube and the air is blown in forcing the plastic tube which then takes up the shape of the die cavity.</p> <h4><strong>Injection Moulding</strong></h4> <p>Injection moulding is one of the most common of all plastics manufacturing processes in which the polymer in the form of granules is heated and forced into a closed mould. As very high pressure is required to feed the fused polymer into the mould, the machine and the mould should be capable of withstanding the force involved during operation.</p> <h4><strong>Rotational Moulding</strong></h4> <p>Rotational moulding is used for producing hollow thermoplastic products such as drums, storage tanks and litter bins. A pre-determined amount of plastic is placed in a closed mould which is then thoroughly heated in an oven to a set temperature and rotated slowly around both vertical and horizontal axes.</p> <h4><strong>Calendering</strong></h4> <p>In calendaring, the fused thermoplastic is extruded onto heated rotating rollers that squeeze the material into a continuous sheet or film.</p> <h4><strong>Compression Moulding</strong></h4> <p>It is one of the oldest techniques of manufacturing which is mostly used for the processing of thermosetting plastics. A pre-heated lower mould cavity which has the thermosetting polymer is subjected to further heat and pressure provided by a press. Polymerization and the flow of the plasticized material within the mould take place due to the excess pressure and heat applied.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_27370\" style=\"width: 600px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-27370\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/Machines-for-plastics-processing.jpg\" alt=\"Machines for plastics processing\" width=\"600\" height=\"239\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Machines for plastics processing</figcaption></figure> <h3>Used Plastics Machines for Sale</h3> <p>when looking for a plastics machine you might realise that it can be quite an expensive affair. One of the most popular solution that many plants and businesses do is to buy a used plastics machinery for their plant.

Due to the high price of new machines the owners take good care of the machines that why when they are offered for sale the used plastic processing machines can be in top condition.</p> <h3>Manufacturers of Plastic Processing Equipment</h3> <p>A few leading plastic processing equipment manufacturers in the world are Krauss-Maffei,  BBM Maschinenbau und Vertriebs GmbH, Davis-Standard Extrusion Systems, <strong>ARBURG</strong>, <strong>BOY</strong>, <strong>Meccanoplastica S.r.l., Urola s.c, TECHNE, Enpas, KOSME </strong>and<strong> Windsor.</strong></p>"},{"id":"1594_en","content":""},{"id":"1597_en","content":""},{"id":"1600_en","content":""},{"id":"1598_en","content":""},{"id":"1624_en","content":""},{"id":"1625_en","content":""},{"id":"1621_en","content":"<h2>Used Machine Tools for sale</h2> <p>All machines, which can be used to transform preliminary products and raw materials into finished products, <strong> are called machine tools</strong>. They are differentiated between <strong>cutting</strong>, <strong>joining</strong> and <strong>forming</strong> tools. A machine tool is any machine that operates by other than hand power in employing a tool to work on metal or other rigid materials. Machine tools are used for drilling, boring, shearing, cutting, shaping and grinding. Used Machine Tools can be found in many different auctions on TradeMachines.</p> <h2>Machine Tools And Their Major Manufacturers</h2> <p>Machine tools as we know them today were created when the toolpath, or relative movement between the tool and the work piece, was first guided by the machine itself rather than by the direct guidance of a human hand. Early lathes and potter's wheels could perhaps be seen as the pioneering forms of this kind of equipment. Today there is a huge variety of machine tools available, whether powered hydraulically, electrically or via a line shaft. Examples include grinding machines, milling machines, broaching machines, lathes, hones, shears, planers, saws, screw machines, drill presses, hobbing machines and gear shapers. The JUNKER group is a definite global leader when it comes to high speed CBN grinding machines, offering equipment ranging from individual machines up to entire production lines. The TOYODA company have a reputation for producing excellent horizontal boring mills. In the field of drill presses, RYOBI and CRAFTSMAN seem to lead the field. WAGNER are noted for high quality heavy duty lathes, as are BINNS &amp; BERRY, who combine acclaimed innovation and technology in their outstanding Versa-Turn 7 heavy duty flat bed lathes. CLIMAX offer a range of world class precision milling machines. The OHIO BROACH AND MACHINE company are specialists in broaching machines and have a sterling reputation in the trade. MITSUBISHI and LORENZ are very popular brands of gear shapers. If you are looking to buy machine tools you can find items such as those mentioned above in used machine tools auctions.</p> <h2>The Advantages Of Buying Used Machine Tools At Auction</h2> <p>If you wish to buy machine tools you might wish to consider the possibilities offered by used machine tool auctions. Such auctions provide the ideal opportunity to buy used machine tools at bargain prices that are far less than you would pay to buy new. Brand new machine tool equipment can prove to be a major expense. Buy used machine tools that have been maintained well by their previous owners and, designed to be robust as they are, you will have a piece of kit that will last you a long time.</p> <h2>Manufacturers Of Machine Tools</h2> <p>ABSOLUTE, AJAX, ALESAMONTI, ALZMETALL, AMADA, APCO, AWEA, AZ, BIESSE, BINNS &amp; BERRY, BOST, BZT, CASADEI, CASATI, CASI, CENTAURO, CERUTI, CHEVALIER, CHUNG SING, CLIMAX, COLGAR, COLLET &amp; ENGELHARD, CRAFTSMAN, DANOBAT, DAYTON, DELTA, DEVLIEG, DIPAOLO, DMG, DMTG, DOOSAN, EINHELL, ELSA, EMPCO, ENTRUST, FAIR FRIEND, FEMCOUSA, FERMAT, FLOTT, FPT, FREJOTH, FULLPOWER, GENERAL INTERNATIONAL, GIDDINGS &amp; LEWIS, GK, GRIGGIO, GRIZZLY, HAAS, HALES, HARRIS, HNK, HURCO, HYUNDAI, IMMERMAN, INDUSTRIAL, JET, JTEKT, JUARISTI, JUNKER, KNUTH, KOMATSU, KRAMER, LAZZATI, LINDNER, LORENZ, LUCAS PRECISION MACHINE, MAG, MAKINO, MISUMI, MITSUBISHI, MODERN PROCESS, MORBIDELLI, MORI SEIKI, NEWLAND, NICOLAS CORREA, NILES, NS, OHIO, OKUMA, PADE, PAMA, PAOLONI, PARPAS, PEGARD, PFEIFFER, RAFAMET, RIKON, ROBBI, ROLLBOCKE, ROMI, RYOBI, SCHARMANN, SCHULER, SCM, SHENYANG, SHOP FOX, SHW, SIBO, SIR MECCANICA, SKODA, SNK, SUPERTEC, SPACY, TECHSPEX, TOSHIBA, TOYODA, TRUMPF, UNION, VANGUARD, VARNSDORF, VITAP, WAGNER, WEINGARTNER, WITHERS, WMW, WOTAN, YAMA SEIKI, YAMAZAKI MAZAK.</p>"},{"id":"1622_en","content":"<h2>Metalworking Machines</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Metalworking machines</strong> include a lot more than is commonly thought. Metalworking machines do not just encompass bending and milling metal products. It also includes surface treatment, refining and changing the material characteristics of a workpiece.

This includes casting,<a href=\"//trademachines.com/spritzgiessmaschinen\"><strong> injection moulding</strong></a> and die casting processes. These differ greatly in terms of their structure, type and size. Cast products are produced in a foundry. The prepared molds are filled with liquid metal directly out of the furnace using heavy lathes. This work can be undertaken with remote control, but it cannot be done automatically with the proper equipment. Die casting machines only have a small supply for molten metal, but this is continually refilled. They can automatically produce a large amount of finished die cast products.<br /> The second form of metalworking is usually called “<br /> <strong>forming</strong>”. This is when plastic or cold pre-products are shaped using a specific application of pressure.  This includes bending, forging and pressing processes. There are a large number of metalworking machines, which could be used to undertake these processes.<br /> The third metal forming process is <strong>separation</strong>, which is undertaken through processes without a tool including turning, milling, cutting, burning and sawing, or when using equipment, punching.</p>\r\n<h3>Treating Metal Surfaces</h3>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_8166\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8166\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/met-2-300x113.jpg\" alt=\"Grinding machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"113\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grinding the surface of metal</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>The treatment of metal surfaces is undertaken to protect the workpiece against corrosion, for aesthetic reasons and to improve the mechanical characteristics of the material.

This includes galvanizing, chrome plating and gold plating. Galvanizing and chrome plating are technically very demanding processes. Therefore, pigment based processes are usually used where it the technical requirements are not as high. This includes powder coating and lacquering. There are technical solutions and special metalworking machines available for both processes as well as used metal working machinery should be considered as they are totally profitable.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Changing Material Characteristics</h3>\r\n<p>Cast and forged products usually do not have the desired characteristics and so after the forming processes, annealing and hardening processes are used. Furnaces and hardening metalworking machines are available for this task. These are also included under the overarching term of used metal working machinery.</p>\r\n<h3>Suppliers of Used Metal working Machinery and Equipment</h3>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_23942\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-23942\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/TRAUB-TND-360-CNC-Drehmaschine1-300x200-300x200-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"A TRAUB CNC Machine Center Model TND 360\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A TRAUB CNC Machine Center Model TND 360</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p><strong>Frech</strong>, <strong>Urpe</strong> and <strong>Wotan</strong> have been established manufacturers for forming machines and equipment like die casting machines for decades.

High lift order pickers are industrial trucks and can be moved freely on the floor. They belong to man-up forklifts, i.e. the driver's cab is lifted together with the load section, so the vehicles are perfectly suited for order picking. </span></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33624 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/high-lift-order-picker-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"High lift order picker\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">High lift order picker and its structure</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A high lift order picker consists of a </span><b>compact chassis</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with a </span><b>lift mast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> attached. Most of order pickers have a telescopic system to reach the required heights. They can reach a lifting height of more than </span><b>14 metres</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - which corresponds to the height of a five-storey building when accepting 1 floor = 2,6 metres.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A high-lift order picker can be designed as a vehicle or as a manual </span><b>lifting device</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. These are usually three-wheeled vehicles with a narrow turning circle - a characteristic that is necessary for driving onto a </span><b>high-bay warehouse</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. High-bay warehouses can accommodate many goods on a small footprint.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">High lift order pickers are usually electrically operated. Particularly powerful variants are equipped with a gas engine, whereby the vehicles with the gas drive are rather rare due to exhaust emissions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The load capacity of high-lift order pickers depends largely on the </span><b>model and manufacturer.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> However, it can reach up to 1.5 tonnes. The maximum driving speed of these industrial trucks is approximately 12 km/ h.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">High lift order pickers can be extended with </span><b>numerous accessories</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Thanks to the load handling devices (LHD), whole pallets can be lifted. The removal and storage of goods is carried out very quickly and easily with the help of order pickers up to the highest shelves. In addition, they have the advantage that the order picker moves up together with the driver's cab and the LHD. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where are high lift order pickers used?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Order pickers are commonly used in high-bay warehouses. The order picker machine is the ideal aid for storing and removing incoming and outgoing products. Like other vehicles this type, high-lift order pickers can also be equipped with recording systems. The laser and barcode systems are more and more often being replaced by RFID (Radio-frequency identification) chips in modern dispatch warehouses. These radio-based recording systems are optically independent and can be used to locate a product as well as to register and deregister it. Equipped with an RFID sensor, a high-lift order picker in a high-bay warehouse is a particularly powerful tool.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are the most popular models of high lift order pickers?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can find a wide selection of </span><b>used order picker auctions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on Trademachines.

Most have one front axle with one or more tandem axles. Variants on the basic idea include the <strong>semi trailer</strong> <strong>end dumper truck</strong>, in which the trailer itself houses the hydraulic hoist; the bottom dumper, which has a dump gate in the belly of the trailer, allowing the driver to deposit in a windrow formation; and the bucket truck, which facilitates the depositing of the load to left or right.

The principle behind this equipment was discovered by Michael Faraday in the early 1830s, and our modern generators developed from the electromagnetic induction dynamo. Today's generators can be powered by petrol, diesel or gas, or they may use a hybrid system. With generators, versatility and convenience are the key elements. Industrial generators can be used in situations or places where there is no readily available electricity supply, such as on construction sites or remote areas. Power cuts due to adverse weather conditions or other causes can be a major inconvenience, but a generator can keep a business functioning until the supply is restored. Similarly, a portable generator in the home can keep the lights on and the power flowing on the domestic front.</p> <h2>Used Industrial Generators For Sale</h2> <p>The Secons hand market for <strong>used portable</strong> or <strong>industrial generators</strong> is gradually <strong>expanding,</strong> as new equipment can be prohibitively expensive. It's possible to find a <strong>used</strong> <strong>industrial generators</strong> for sale that is fully functional and which can serve your purposes for years to come, as manufacturers tend to build industrial strength, robust equipment that is made to last. Industrial generators are designed to work wherever and whenever they are needed, so you can buy <strong>used with confidence.</strong> The best means of <strong>buying a used generator for sale</strong> is via an online Second hand market or industrial auctions as they gives you the chance to take a good look at what's available out there and obtain the cheap generator you need.</p> </p> <h3>Buying Used Generators - Advantages</h3> <p><strong>Used generator for sales</strong> are steadily increasing as buyers opt out of buying new.

Just like simple table drilling machines, radial drilling machines are known for their high level of repeat accuracy and ability to create straight, accurate holes in clamped-down raw material. In addition to the entire boom being able to pivot, rapid radial drilling machines have a particularly high rotation speed, quick feed and high level of machine stability. Rapid radial drilling machines also allow for particularly efficient production of hole templates in resistant material. </p><h2>Where are rapid radial drilling machines used?</h2><p>Rapid radial drilling machines are generally used in areas of mechanical engineering, where conventional radial drilling machines can no longer be efficiently used. Radial rapid drilling machines are manually operated machines, which are not so suitable for series production. Just like radial drilling machines, the workpieces need to be well clamped in. The production of individual pieces or small series components can be very efficiently undertaken on these machines. They are usually only used in special facilities, as they require much higher costs than their conventional counterparts.  </p><h2>What is the structure of a rapid radial drilling machine?</h2><p>The basic structure of a rapid radial drilling machine consists of a pillar with a round cross-section. This pillar has a cantilever arm attached to it, whose height can be adjusted. The drilling machines is then attached to this arm. The workpiece is attached to a separate work table. The drilling machine can be moved up and down, and also backwards and forwards along the boom. The boom can pivot, which means that the drilling machine can reach all areas of the workpiece. </p><p>Rapid radial drilling machines are made as mid-sized industrial drilling machines. In addition to the extensive adjustment possibilities to the drilling tool, rapid radial drilling machines can also be equipped with cooling lubricant. Rapid radial drilling machines are more stable than normal radial drilling machines, and are just as sensitive to misuse. The cutting and lifting power, which is created during the process, is the same as that that occurs on conventional machines. </p><p>Since rapid radial drilling machines are cutting machines, they need to be regularly cleaned. </p>"},{"id":"1306_en","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">What is an automatic punching machine?</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">An automatic punching machine is a machine tool, which is used to separate thin-walled materials. Automatic punching machines are closely related to punching press. As they were further developed, automatic punching machines no longer required human staff for operation, unlike the conventional punching press.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Where are automatic punching machines used?</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A automatic punching machine is applied where a large amount of series components need to be produced in a very short space of time. They are most suited for processing wood panels, plastic panels, plastic films, rubber materials and sheet metal. In addition to reducing the need for permanent handling, automatic punching machines have a much higher output rate than manual punching press. This means that they are also very economic. Useful additions for automatic punching machines are industrial robots or reels. Cut-to-length lines are also often equipped with a punching machine.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">What types of automatic punching machines are available</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Generally, all punching presses can be transformed into automatic punching machines. Due to the automatic nature of these machines, a lot of safety features that are required for manual punching presses are no longer needed. Automatic punching machines are pneumatically operated in the packaging industry. An automatic punching machines is often integrated into the assembly lines for the production of cartons and film packaging. For metal processing, automatic punching machines are electro-mechanically operated. The most common types are knee lever punches, spindle-powered punches or punches with an eccentric drive. Hydraulically operated machines are less common. Hydraulic punches are only used for very tough or particularly thick material. The hydraulically operated punching process is much slower than the electromechanical or pneumatic punches. This means that they are very inefficient when run automatically.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">There is a higher amount of pressure required for the separation of material, particularly sheet metal, than for forming processes. Automatic punching machines, including automatic paper punching machine, automatic die punching machine, automatic spiral punching machine and automatic hole punching machine, can also be used as an automatic press. Automatic punching machines can produce a large amount of processed material in a short amount of time. It is important to have continual quality control. The processes of an assembly line, where an automatic punching machine is integrated, all need to be very precisely coordinated with one another. Without continual monitoring of the production process and results, there is always the risk that a lot of waste will be produced.</p>"},{"id":"1310_en","content":"<h3>Drilling Equipment - From Small Workshops to Mass Production</h3>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6952\" style=\"width: 201px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-6952 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/ALZMETALL_drilling_machine-201x300-201x300.jpg\" alt=\"ALZMETALL drilling machine for workshops\" width=\"201\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Drill machines are used for performing a surface treatment on metal sheets</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Drilling equipment is available in a variety of different strengths and sizes, but in general, their structure is almost always the same.

In most cases, the motor is electric. However, there are also pneumatically operated drilling machines available. Hydraulically operated motors are rare and only useful for very difficult conditions. The speed of the drill machine is monitored by a potentiometer that is attached to the motor or by the gear mechanism. For handheld machines, operators are in control of guiding the drill and feeding in the material. These drilling machines are often used for areas that are inaccessible, assembly work and for reparations. A hand drilling machine is uncommonly used for mass production, where box column drills and pillar drills are more commonly used so it can be considered heavy equipment. For these types of drills, the drill is mounted vertically on a frame and is guided towards the material using a hand operated wheel or lever. The drilling table contains (especially when used in the metal industry) a clamping device. This is so the operator of the drilling machine only has to worry about positioning and guiding the drill. The step-up from these types of drills is the automatic drilling center, where a feed system and a sensor take over the tasks usually undertaken by the operator. These drill machines make it possible to have <strong>high processing rates in mass production</strong>. Tool-less chuck systems are also now commonly used, rather the formerly used sprockets. Therefore, a number of various systems have been developed that sometimes have incompatible components, like drills. Drills are high-end industrial products, which can often be refurbished and reused. Parts of drilling machine; bench drill, head drill, rotary, etc. cannot be easily be obtained. It is always a better option to find the whole used drilling machine instead of the parts of it. </p>\r\n<p>On the industrial auctions is possible to find used drilling equipment and drilling machine parts of it, it is <strong>recommendable to compare prices</strong> of different used drilling machines and identify which are the tasks that will be developed.</p>\r\n<h4>Operating a Drilling Machine</h4>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6955\" style=\"width: 221px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-6955 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/used_DONAU_radial_drilling_machine-221x300-221x300.jpg\" alt=\"DONAU Radial drilling machine\" width=\"221\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Safety measures are a must when operating big drilling machines</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Even though a small drill machine is one of simplest hand tools to operate, the operator should have thorough instruction on how to use this device. <strong>Negligent handling can lead to the operator being injured and the products being damaged</strong>. It is important that the drill machine chosen is the right one for the required task. Metal drills are not just metal drills; there are big differences between the drills that are made out of soft or hard metals. Used drilling machinery that has high speeds are more dangerous to work with.

Column drilling machines stand independently while<strong> pillar drill machine</strong>s are built as a <strong>table machine</strong>. They have a small worktable, upon which the workpiece is attached using a clamping device or screw clamps. A lifting device is attached to the drilling machine. An adjusting wheel and an (in most cases) automatic lever are used to guide the drilling spindle towards the workpiece. The fact that the workpiece is attached means that it does not slip. The <strong>pillar drill machine</strong> is always guided vertically, which allows for precise holes to be drilled.</p>\r\n<h3>Uses of the Pillar Drill Machines</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Pillar drills</strong> are used to process plastic, wood workpieces and where you need to boring holes in metal. They are used to create a variety of holes including through holes, threaded holes, guide holes or other types of holes. <strong>Pillar drilling machines</strong> are also very popular among hobbyists. They are not suited for producing series components.

The difference is that the workpiece is fixed in place, while the tool (the drill) slowly rotates on the desired area where the hole is to be drilled. <strong>The drill is restricted by bezels</strong>. These bezels are adjustable, so that the drill can go as deep into the material as required. A deep hole drill machine has an internal cooling lubricant. The deep drill is equipped with a hollow channel, through which a large amount of cooling lubricant flows. If there was no coolant, the rubbing between the tip of the drill and the material would quickly lead to the drill seizing up. This would damage the drill and the workpiece. The cooling lubricant is also used to bring the metal chippings out of the hole. Without this, the drilling process would very quickly get blocked up. As an integral component to ensure that the machine continues to function reliably, cooling lubricant is required for deep hole drilling machines. <strong>Deep drills are available as small and mid-sized drills with hard metal tips, which are sharpened several times.</strong> Large deep drilling machines are equipped with one or several replaceable plates. Large deep hole drills can also be extended. Deep drills are available from diameters of just 0.8mm up to 1,800mm.</p> <h2>Where are deep hole drilling machines used?</h2> <p>Deep hole drilling machines and tools are used for special machine construction. The requirement of deep holes is <strong>usually needed for the production of hydraulic tubes in machines</strong>. Control blocks for hydraulically operated machines are, for example, made out of massive metal blocks with precise holes. A deep drilling machine is used by machine manufacturers themselves or contract manufacturers. Further uses of a hole drilling machine are for the production of hollow shafts and specialised bar material.</p> <p><img class=\"wp-image-9518 size-full\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/dhdm-1.jpg\" alt=\"Deep hole drilling\" width=\"810\" height=\"263\" /></p>"},{"id":"1309_en","content":""},{"id":"1333_en","content":"<h3>Die Sinking Erosion Machines aka EDM Machine</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_27430\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-27430\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/EDM-Sinker-erosion-machine.jpg\" alt=\"EDM Sinker erosion machine\" width=\"400\" height=\"345\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">EDM Sinker erosion machine</figcaption></figure> <p>There are two basic variants of the<strong> EDM process</strong> based on the type of electrode used which is basically the cutting tool: Die sinking EDM and Wire cut EDM. A pre-shaped or formed electrode usually made from graphite or copper, which is machined in the exact opposite shape as the one required in the workpiece is used as the tool in the die sinking EDM process and it is fed vertically down. Whereas in the case of <strong>wire cut EDM</strong>, a continuously traveling vertical wire electrode which has the diameter of a small needle or less than that is used to cut a narrow slot through the workpiece to produce the desired shape.</p> <h3>Die Sinking Erosion Machines Types</h3> <p>The basic elements of a die sinker EDM machine are: electrode, dielectric medium and work piece with auxiliary units like power supply and CNC control which are indispensable for the process to take place.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Electrode</strong> – It is the actual tool for removing the material. The most commonly used electrode materials are graphite, brass and other copper alloys, pure tungsten and tungsten alloys and copper graphite. Because of the inherent properties of graphite-like the high melting point above 3000°C, low heat conductivity, easy machinability and also since it is inexpensive, graphite is the most preferred electrode material.</li> <li><strong>Workpiece</strong> – Electrically conductive material in which the required profile is to be cut.</li> <li><strong>Dielectric Unit</strong> – Hydrocarbons oils are used as dielectric fluids between the electrode and the job in the vertical EDM machines. The dielectric fluid acts as an insulator until a required amount of voltage is applied after which it ionizes, producing a controlled spark which vaporizes and erodes the metal from the workpiece. The heat of each spark ranges from 15,000° to 21,000° Fahrenheit and sparking occurs in a frequency range from 2,000 to 500,000 sparks per second. The dielectric also acts as a pressurized cooling fluid which cools the vaporized metal and flushes the eroded materials off the gap. The dielectric fluid passes through a filter to remove suspended particles so that it can be reused.</li> </ul> <h3>Auxiliary Units Of Die Sinker Edm Machine</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Power Supply</strong> – A pre-determined voltage is generated by a DC or AC servo system between the wire electrode and the workpiece for maintaining the spark. The tool is made the negatively charged electrode while the part to be cut is made the anode.</li> <li><strong>Computer Numerical Control</strong> – The CNC control is accountable for the accurate movement of the tool over the workpiece to be machined. Other features include technology to aid in the prevention of wire breaks, background editing and graphic display of programs while the machine is under operation. With a single CNC program fed into the system, several thousands of identical parts can be machined with less operator assistance. The control also monitors the offset of the tool.</li> </ul> <h3>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Die Sinker EDM</h3> <p>The most important advantage of sinker EDM process is that it can machine anything which is electrically conductive irrespective of the other mechanical properties of the metal such as hardness, ductility etc. Therefore, it is considered to be the most suitable method for fabricating hardened steels. On the negative side, it is the major limitation as well. It is not suitable for machining non-conductive materials such as plastics. The secondary advantage of ram EDM process when compared to conventional machining is that it does not set any limits on the depth of the surface that can be machined. There are no notable mechanical stresses acting on the tool or the workpiece in the EDM process unlike the other machining processes like milling, turning, grinding etc. In the latter processes, the deeper the shape, the larger cutter diameter must be selected because of the cutting force and vibrations caused by the rotating movement. One more advantage of sinker EDM machine is its capability to produce three-dimensional parts (3D) while only two-dimensional geometries (2D) can be produced by wire EDM process. The finished jobs of EDM process are burr free and with excellent surface finish thus eliminating the need for subsequent finishing or secondary operations.</p> <p>When compared to the wire EDM process which employs a wire to erode the material instead of a form machined electrode, die sinking process is slightly disadvantageous in the sense that there occurs wearing of the tool. But with certain combinations of electrode and workpiece materials and by adjusting certain process parameters there is a possibility to achieve a condition called as ‘no-wear machining’. Also, it involves extra cost and time for the development of electrodes used in the die sinking process which is not the case in wire EDM. Generally in both the EDM variants, the material removal rate is very low and the power consumption is too quite high.</p> <p>A few famous suppliers of die sinking EDM machines in the world are MAKINO, ANOTRONIC, Heun, Knuth Machine Tools, GF AgieCharmilles, ONA Electro-Erosion, Sodick, EXERON, OSCAR, Creator Precision, OPS-INGERSOLL Funkenerosion GmbH, MAXSEE, NEUAR, CHMER, JOEMARS and KAAST Werkzeugmaschinen GmbH. </p> <p></p>"},{"id":"1340_en","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong style=\"background-color: initial\">Planer Milling Machines</strong></h2> <figure id=\"attachment_10312\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10312\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/planer-type-milling-machine.jpg\" alt=\"Jobs Jomach Planer Type Milling Machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Planer Type Milling Machine with CNC control</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Planer type mills</strong> are the largest milling machines. Their general appearance and construction are those of a large planer but the difference is that milling is performed instead of planing.

The worktable and bed of the machine are heavy and relatively low to the ground, and the milling heads are supported by a bridge structure that spans across the table. These <a href=\"//trademachines.com/milling-machines\"><strong>heavy duty milling machines</strong></a>, called Plano-miller, look like planing machine where the single point tools are replaced by one or a number of milling heads; generally used for machining a number of longitudinal flat surfaces simultaneously, viz., lathe beds, table and bed of planning machine etc. Planer machines are similar to bed type machines but are equipped with several cutters and heads to mill various surfaces.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Milling Machine and Planer</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">It is often desired that the operations of milling and planing can be combined together so that one machine capable of performing both the operations can be used which saves a lot of factory space, money and time. Thus, milling attachments were made for the planer in a single machine, and attached to the cross-rail. The changes required from the planer drive, are an extra belt to rotate the cutter, and a special countershaft to slow down the move merit of the table. This attachment can carry a slabbing, gang, or formed cutter on an arbour for horizontal milling; or it can carry end mills, by turning the attached head through 90 degrees, thus bringing the spindle to a vertical position. This last arrangement of the spindle is of great utility, as it allows cutters to reach down into places which would be inaccessible by any other means.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_10314\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10314\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/planer-type-milling.jpg\" alt=\"Burkhardt and Weber Planer Type Milling Machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Part Machining with a Planer Type Milling Machine</figcaption></figure> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Planer Milling Machines and its Applications</strong></h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Some of the industrial applications where planer type milling machines play an important role are:</p> <ul style=\"text-align: justify\"> <li>It is widely used in industries for precise shaping of metals &amp; various solid materials.</li> <li>These machines are ideal for various processes such as slot cutting, routing, welding &amp; turning in metallurgical industries.</li> <li>The machine is intended for milling of housing and basic components made of ferrous and non-ferrous metals and of some selected plastics.</li> </ul> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Buying Planer Type Milling Machines</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">From the viewpoint of saving time and effort it is often desirable to combine milling and planing operations in a single machine.

The position and type of tool is stored into the milling programme. The milling process occurs in two stages for high-end final products. “Stripping”, or “roughing”, is used to reduce excess material down to a few millimetres. <strong>Stripping</strong> is a very rough process, which can be undertaken quickly and does not require much precision. Roughing is used to mill the workpiece down to the exact desired dimensions. This two part milling process is particularly important for hard materials, which have high requirements for dimensional accuracy.

EDM is one of the most extensively used non-conventional machining process because of its increasing ability to machine metals at higher speeds. It is a thermal erosion process which works on the principle of spark erosion. Several recurring electrical discharges are created between the cutting tool which in this case is an electrode and the work piece which is electrically conductive. The process takes place in the presence of a dielectric fluid. EDM can be broadly classified into three major types namely: Wire cut EDM, Die Sinking or Ram EDM and Start hole erosion EDM. </p><p> <strong>What is Start Hole Erosion EDM?</strong></p><p>  Small Hole EDM is an improved method of utilizing EDM to drill small holes in conductive material at speeds that are typically 10 times faster than those achieved with conventional Die Sinker or Ram EDM process which was earlier used to drilling of holes by electrical discharge machining. Small Hole EDM is now recognized and accepted as the third method of EDM Machining along with Sinker EDM and Wire EDM. Small hole EDM drilling, also known as fast hole EDM drilling, hole popper, and start hole EDM drilling, uses a rotating tubular electrode with a diameter of 0.1 mm to 6 mm to drill holes by means of electrical discharge machining by eroding material from the work piece in the presence of a water dielectric. These holes may have a depth-to-diameter ratio of 30 to 1 or higher. Tubular electrodes are rotated at speeds of about 100 RPM while drilling. As the electrical discharges occur, this rotation aids in flushing and provides for uniform electrode wear.</p><p> <strong>History of Start Hole Erosion EDM</strong></p><p> High-speed EDM hole drilling was designed especially for fast, accurate small and deep hole drilling applications. Small holes that were once almost impossible to drill by conventional machine tools are now being performed with ease. Conventional Sinker EDM was successfully applied for the drilling of small holes, however the process was always considered to be very slow when compared to conventional drilling. Then came the invention of a specialized EDM process for the drilling of small holes in the late 1970’s. Start hole erosion EDM drilling which was considered to be the last resort for drilling of small holes is now widely used for production work. This can be attributed to the higher drilling speeds of up to 2 inches per minute achievable with the process nowadays. And holes can be drilled in any electrically conductive material, be it hard or soft including carbides. With the capability of drilling through virtually any conductive material, the use of this technology is continually expanding.</p><p> <strong>Construction and Working of Start Hole Erosion EDM Machine</strong></p><p> The basic elements constituting a start hole erosion EDM machine are: </p><ul>  <li>  Extrusion Stainless  steel work table</li><li>  Rotating spindle</li><li>  Drill chuck or collet  system for holding electrodes</li><li>  Ceramic or diamond  guides</li><li>  Power supply with  control panel</li><li>  Capacitor box</li><li>  Dielectric fluid pump</li></ul><p> Start hole erosion EDM works on the same principle of spark erosion as the wire EDM or die sinker EDM. An electrical discharge is produced across the gap between the contactless electrode and the work piece thereby eroding the material from the job. The process consists of using a precision tubular electrode (generally brass or copper) mounted into the drill chuck located on the \"Z\" axis and held in location on top of the work piece by the ceramic guide. The top of the work piece is located and the drilling depth is set. The electrode rotation is turned on and the deionized water solution, which is pressurized between 50 and 100 kg/cm2, is sent through the tubular electrode as a flushing agent. The power supply parameters are set-which normally consist of on-time, off-time, peak current and amount of capacitance. At this point, the discharge is turned on to begin the drilling cycle. At the end of the drilling cycle, the discharge is turned off and the \"Z\" axis is retracted above the work piece. A servo drive is used to maintain the gap between the electrode and work piece. If the electrode touches the work piece, a short occurs and in such cases, the servo drive retracts the electrode. </p><p> <strong>APPLICATIONS OF START HOLE EROSION EDM PROCESS</strong></p><p> Small hole drilling EDM has got wider field of applications. As the process is capable of producing burr free holes, it eliminates the usage of any secondary deburring process. And it is considered to be the most cost effective method for drilling fast and accurate holes in any conductive metals. Although originally conceived as a method of economically producing small holes with large depth-to-diameter ratios, Small Hole EDM is now utilized in just about any situation in many industries where conventional drilling a small hole is normally difficult: Automotive- Diesel fuel injection nozzles, Textile– Fiber spinning nozzles, Wire drawing– Small draw dies, Aerospace– Turbine blade cooling holes, Semiconductor– Silicon masks, Tool, Die, &amp; Mold– Small Hole EDM drilling is ideal for putting ejector holes in hardened punches, coolant holes in cutting tools, vent holes in molds,wire EDM starting holes. And as many of the start hole erosion EDM machines utilize distilled water as the flushing agent, it opens up new applications in the medical field as well. </p><p> ONA ELECTRO EROSION, Heun Funkenerosion GmbH, Mitsubishi EDM, ANG International, POSALUX, Aristech, Current EDM are some of the worldwide manufacturers of small hole drilling EDM machines.&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"1339_en","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Knee Type Milling Machine</h2> <h5 style=\"text-align: justify\">Classification of Milling Machines</h5> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Milling can be defined as the process of removing material from a work piece by feeding it against a rotary <strong>multi point cutting tool</strong> called as the milling cutter. Milling machines are the most versatile machines used in the industries for the machining of flat surfaces, spirals, helixes, grooves, slots and complex contours etc. and they are basically classified as being horizontal or vertical indicating the axis of the milling machine spindle. Milling machines can also be classified based on the<strong> configuration of the work table</strong> or bed as:</p> <ul style=\"text-align: justify\"> <li><strong>Knee type</strong></li> <li><strong>Bed type</strong></li> <li><strong>Planer type</strong></li> <li><strong>Rotary table type</strong></li> </ul> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Knee Type Milling Machine Configuration</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_9836\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9836\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/knee-milling-machine.jpg\" alt=\"Knee Milling Machine\" width=\"400\" height=\"262\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">FRITZ WERNER Knee Milling Machine</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Knee mill machine is a commonly used general purpose machine in factories. The name, “Knee type milling machine” is because of the fact that the work table is supported on a knee-like casting which can slide in a vertical direction along the column to which it is rigidly clamped to in a position where the milling head and milling machine spindle are properly adjusted for operation. The principal components of a knee milling machine are:</p> <ul style=\"text-align: justify\"> <li><strong>Work table</strong> – The work piece is clamped onto the work table using the T-slots.</li> <li><strong>Saddle</strong> – The function of a saddle is to support the work table</li> <li><strong>Knee</strong> – It supports the saddle and gives the table vertical movements, thereby responsible for the adjustment of the depth of cut.</li> <li><strong>Overarm</strong> – It is used in horizontal machines to accommodate different arbor lengths.</li> <li><strong>Milling Head</strong> – It contains the spindle and cutter holders. The head may be fixed or vertically adjustable in vertical machines depending on the purpose of use.</li> </ul> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Motion in a Knee Type Milling Machine</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The milling machine's <strong>knee travels vertically</strong>, rides up or down the column on a rigid track also supporting the saddle and table. The <strong>saddle</strong> resting upon the knee <strong>moves in and out from the column</strong>, while the <strong>worktable traverses to the right or left</strong> upon the saddle for feeding the work piece past the milling cutter. The table may be manually controlled or power fed. Additionally, the ram, at the top of the column, which supports the milling head containing the motor, tool head, speed and feed controls, quill and spindle can be moved both in and out from the column and can be tilted for angular milling and drilling as well. The non-rotating quill holds the rotating spindle.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Knee Type Milling Machine Types</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Knee milling machines can be further sub-divided into two types as <strong>horizontal and vertical machines</strong> depending on the <strong>axis of rotation</strong>. The plain vertical machines are characterized by a spindle located vertically, parallel to the column face, and mounted in a sliding head in which the feeding can be done up and down. Modern vertical milling machines are designed in such a way that the entire milling head can also be swivelled to a certain extent for the purpose of exclusively working on angular surfaces.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">In a plain horizontal milling machine, column contains the drive motor and gearing and milling spindle is fixed at a particular position horizontally . An adjustable overhead arm containing one or more arbor supports projects forward from the top of the column. The primary function of the arm and its supports is to stabilize long arbors. Supports can be moved along the overhead arm to support the arbor wherever necessary depending on the position of the milling cutter. With various attachments, knee type milling machines can be used for various operations like boring, slotting, reaming, circular milling and drilling.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Knee Mill Machine Manufacturers</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Some of the milling machine manufacturers in the world are: BRETON, COMI, KLOPP, Knuth Machine Tools, SAJO, Milltronics Manufacturing, MAKINO, Danobat group, MAZAK and DMG MORI SEIKI, RECKERMANN etc.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Buying Used Knee Type Milling Machines</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">You can see most of the available used milling machines for sale in our website because of the partnership, TradeMachines has with several leading industrial auction houses in UK, USA and other countries. Based on your needs and cost constraints on buying used milling machines, you can decide on the one which suits your purpose at a single platform from where you will be taken directly to the online auctioning event.</p> <p></p>"},{"id":"1341_en","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">ToolRoom Milling Machines</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_10175\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10175\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/11/tool-room-mill.jpg\" alt=\"relevant machine-suggestions MAHO MH 700 S/432 CNC Universal Toolroom Milling and Drilling Machine MAHO MH 700 S/432 CNC Universal Toolroom Milling and Drilling Machine 0 Gebote9,000 €04-22-2015 14:49 DECKEL FP 4 A Tool Room Milling Machine DECKEL FP 4 A Tool Room Milling Machine 2 Gebote6,500 €04-01-2015 10:00 MIKRON WF 31 C Toolroom Mill MIKRON WF 31 C Toolroom Mill 0 Gebote2,500 €Closed WMW HECKERT FW 400-VI Universal-Toolroom Milling Machine WMW HECKERT FW 400-VI Universal-Toolroom Milling Machine 12 Gebote1,100 €04-16-2015 11:16 Surplex - it’s so easy to bid!

Only the <strong>tips of the teeth have to be harder, </strong>but a diamond coating on the saw blade can enhance the metal saw. Saw blades for metal cutting saws have extremely small teeth. The size of the teeth is due to the hard and tough material that they are made of. Metal can only be separated in small stages. Large teeth would be bend immediately. The saw blade of hacksaw or metal bandsaw and reciprocating saws are in the form of a band. With <strong>circular saws </strong>they are round. Alternatively to a toothed saw blade, a rotating separator sheet on an angle grinder can also be used. </p> <p>Metal saws range from simple, manual hacksaws through to powered horizontal or vertical band saws and circular saws. When looking for a <strong>metal saw for sale</strong>, it's best to give some thought to the exact nature of the jobs you'll want to use it for and tailor your purchase accordingly. Vertical band saws are particularly useful in cutting curving or unusual shapes. Additionally, there are abrasive saws, otherwise known as metal chop saw, which are conveniently light and portable. These items have found a great deal of favour on building sites and smaller workshops as they can perform jobs previously done chiefly by the use of acetylene torches.</p> <h3>The Structure of a Metal Cutting Saw</h3> <p>Mechanical saws consist of a saw blade, a clamp and a motor. Electric circular saws, bandsaws and hacksaws are stationary machines, which are equipped with their own work table and stop. Thereby, <strong>metal cutting saws</strong> are set up for a variety of tasks can produce very precise cuts. The preparation of a metal block for further processing on a  <a href=\"//trademachines.com/lathes\"><strong>lathe </strong></a>or<strong> </strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/milling-machines\"><strong>milling machine</strong></a><strong> </strong>can be undertaken on a stationary saw. Just like all metal cutting machines, electric saws are also equipped with a cooling lubricant. Reciprocating saws are electric hand tools, used to free-handedly separate metal. They are commonly used to recycle automobiles because they can easily be used to cut through the vehicle's beams. <strong>Their advantage is that they are free on one side </strong>. This means that they can be used for complex materials without any problems. These metal hand saws can be used to process tubes and profiles on-site. Reciprocating saws need to produce very precise cuts. The one-sided open saw blade tends to deflect in a lateral direction, which means that the precision of the cut can only occur within the range of a millimetre.</p> <h2>Types of Metal Saws</h2> <p>Various forms of saws designed for cutting metal are available from used industrial equipment auctions. </p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_23903\" style=\"width: 228px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-23903 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/BAILEIGH-BSV24-vertical-band-saw-228x300.jpg\" alt=\"BAILEIGH BSV24 vertical band saw\" width=\"228\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BAILEIGH BSV24 vertical band saw</figcaption></figure></p> <ul> <li>A <a href=\"//trademachines.com/hack-saw\"><strong>Hacksaw</strong></a> may be manually operated or powered.

Precise cuts and the production of complex constructions can be ensured with the implementation of additional applications like guides.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_8075\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8075 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/ms-3-300x197.jpg\" alt=\"Mada Bandsaw\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fully automated metal bandsaw</figcaption></figure></p> <p>Metal bandsaws have the advantage that they do not heat up. The band creates heat during the sawing process, but this is continually expelled into the surrounding air. A metal band saw is suited for precisely cutting tubes, bars and profiles. Metal band saws only require a short cutting surface and can be set to process specific points.</p> <p>Automatic hacksaws generally require a cooling agent. They are characterised by their ability to produce very precise cuts and are more suited for long cuts. Hacksaws are particularly suited to cut metal blocks since the saw maintains the same position throughout the cutting process. In most cases, a cooling agent is required to cool the saw blade and the workpiece, and to remove the chippings.</p> <p><strong>Just like metal cutting saws, circular saws and angle grinders are also used to cut pipes and profiles. </strong>Their advantage is that they have very high cutting speeds. They are less suited to cut metal blocks. The height of the saw blade defines the maximum thickness of the block. Metal cutting circular saws often overheat and jam because cooling agents cannot be easily applied.</p> <p>There are also smaller tools like the metal cutter that can be handled manually that adapt to smaller needs.</p> <h3>Metal Cutting Machine Operation and Safety</h3> <p><figure id=\"attachment_8074\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8074\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/ms-2-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"circular saw\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Solid tooth circular saw</figcaption></figure></p> <p>Saws are used to prepare intermediary metal workpieces. These workpieces will be further processed at different stations, and so it is highly required that the cut metal workpiece is very precise. However, adjustments are also manageable. <strong> Therefore, metal cutting saws can be operated by assistants. </strong>A thorough briefing is very important. Clamping in the workpiece correctly, and adjusting the sawing and feed speeds, need to be well understood and practised by the worker. The attention to work safety is very important. Wear eye protection and suitable protective clothing is obligatory. Metal cutting saws are great machines for first learning how to process metal. Just like all cutting machines, these saws create a large amount of dirt and waste. The correct and thorough cleaning and maintenance of these machines needs to be understood by the operator and then reliably undertaken. Normally, this only consists of switching the saw blade. A metal cutting hand saw is constructed in such a way, that this can be very easily undertaken.</p> <p>However, unskilled assistants should not operate these machines unsupervised. Hacksaws make wide sweeping oscillations and the saw band of a metal bandsaw can suddenly rip. Both are associated with a high risk of injury. All workers need to be briefed on the risks of injury associated with a metal cutting saws before using these machine.</p> <h2>Used Metal Cutting bandsaws for sale</h2> <p>These are very popular in the<strong> used metal cutting saws market</strong>. If you wish to buy used metal cutting saws it's worth bearing in mind that they can be picked up surprisingly cost effectively at second hand industrial machinery market, thereby saving you the often high cost of buying new equipment and having it undergo a rapid depreciation as soon as it's on your site. <strong>Used metal cutting saws for sale</strong> are regularly offered at such market band saw sales, and the sheer variety and depth of the available metal saws, as well as the cost savings to be enjoyed, make them well worth checking out.</p> <p>The second-hand market provides a wide range of used metal saws. <strong>M</strong><strong>etal cutting saws </strong>are characterised by their<strong> robustness. </strong>This means that they can be used over many decades. This long working life is also due to the low levels of precision at which they operate. Therefore, buying one of these second-hand metal saws is generally a non-risky process. However, it is highly recommended to check its functions, particularly the chuck. This is why one can find many offers of second-hand metal <strong>band</strong> <strong>saws sale</strong>.</p> </p> <h3>Suppliers of Metal Cutting Machines</h3> <p>Reciprocating saws for manual work are available from all established power tool manufacturers.

The grinding material used is finely ground and is either bound together in the form of a grinding wheel or band, or is loose (e.g. during lapping).Using sharp grains of sand to remove hard materials is <strong>dated back to the Stone Age</strong>. Rotating grinding stones have been used to sharpen bells from at least the 9<sup>th</sup> century. The first grinding machines were used in the 12<sup>th</sup> century as grinding mills, which were converted from conventional grinders.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7248\" style=\"width: 268px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7248\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/GM-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Grinding machine in use\" width=\"268\" height=\"201\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cylindrical Grinding machine for metalworking</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h3>Areas of Application of Metal Grinding Machines</h3>\r\n<p>There are a number of different types of grinding machines for sale for <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/sheet-metal-working\">sheet metal work</a></strong>, and they are applied for various tasks. Important characteristics to note when looking at a grinding machine are the location of the contact area between the workpiece and tool, and where the cutting movement and main feed direction are situated.  The cutting area is the differentiating factor between side grinding and peripheral grinding. The direction of the movements determines which process (i.e. up grinding, slide grinding or pendulum grinding) can be undertaken. The actual movement of the cut or the feeding movements are controlled by the rotating, and sometimes oscillating, tool. Surface grinders and cylindrical grinders can be used for all general applications. A surface grinder is used to create even surfaces and a cylindrical grinder is used for workpieces with rotational symmetry. <strong>There are internal and external cylindrical grinding machines available</strong>; universal cylindrical grinding machines are a combination of the two. The centre less cylindrical grinder is a special construction with a high stock removal rate and reduced idle time. Tool and form grinders are particularly precise in their work and are used to produce or refurbish tools. For example, <strong>tool grinders</strong> are used to sharpen drills, lathe chisels and mill cutters. Gear grinding machines are used to produce the teeth for gears. Belt grinders are used to produce surfaces of the highest quality, to engrave cast and punched pieces, and clean sheet metal. For workpieces that have very high requirements for their surface quality, shape and dimensional accuracy can be processed using honing and lapping machines.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>grinding process is used to remove large volumes of excess metal in a relatively short time</strong> and to produce items with a high surface quality. Operators can control the movement of the grinding head across a workpiece fixed into position. Alternatively the workpiece can be moved while the abrasive wheel remains fixed. Here are the main types of grinding machines that can be located and purchased with ease at used industrial machinery auctions.   </p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7259\" style=\"width: 324px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7259\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/GM-3-300x229.jpg\" alt=\"Grinder in Workshop\" width=\"324\" height=\"247\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Surface Grinding Machine for the producition of precision ground surfaces</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h2>Grinding Machine Types</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"//trademachines.com/cylindrical-grinding-machine\"><strong>Cylindrical Grinding machines</strong></a>: These are the most common type.

Cylindrical grinding can be divided into four types; outside diameter, inside diameter, creep feed, plunge and centreless grinding.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Centerless Grinding machines:</strong> These differ from centred grinding machines in that there is no spindle on which to secure the workpiece. Instead, it is set in place between a pair of rotary grinding wheels.

Today, the further developed machine-powered hacksaws are used in various branches of industry. The industrial hacksaw can pretty much saw all materials.</p> <h2>What characterises the hacksaw?</h2> <dl id=\"attachment_60781\"> <dt> <figure id=\"attachment_7414\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7414 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/HS-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Electric hacksaw\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hacksaws have characteristic of a U-shaped clamp</figcaption></figure></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">This type of saw has specific characteristics, like the U-shaped clamp, which is open on the bottom. A saw blade, which is fixed in between the ends of the clamp, cuts the various materials using lifting and pushing movements.</p> </dt> </dl> <p>The hack saw has been developed over 4,700 years. Materials have been cut by hacksaws for a millennium. Relics and debris from the Bronze Age provide evidence to show that this type of sawing process was used by the ancient Egyptians. <strong>The power hacksaw was developed in the industrial revolution</strong> and through the introduction of the steam engine. The rapid growth of industrial production led to the development of the electric hacksaw, which now been transformed into a fully automatic machine.</p> <h2>What advantages does the hacksaw have and where is it used?</h2> <p>The function of a hacksaw is very simple and has a variety of advantages. The saw blade, which is fixed between the joints, is very taut due to the tension. Therefore, there is <strong>no chance of it bending</strong>. Additional, incredibly narrow saw blades can be used, which ensure a minimal loss in the workpiece’s material, and allows for minimal cutting processes to be undertaken. Due to stability, the clamp is thicker than the hack saw and it restricts the workpiece due to its height and width.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_7417\" style=\"width: 231px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7417 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/HS-2-231x300.jpg\" alt=\"Hacksaw in workshop\" width=\"231\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The hacksaws blades don't bend</figcaption></figure></p> <p>When using a hand hack saw or junior hack saw, the lifting movement is always an idle stroke. This means that only half of the work is actually productive. Materials that are difficult to cut can be processed using a broaching process, which is where only a few saw teeth are required. <strong>The hand operated hacksaw is mainly used in the wood and metal industry.</strong> Common types of saws used in woodworking are the jig saw, branch saw and frame saw. The hand-held hacksaw is a common tool used for metalworking. The lifting and pushing movements of the power hack saw is powered using a motor and a gear hub, which transforms the rotation movement. The base frame, made out of grey cast iron or cast steel contains all of the mechanical components. The workpiece can be clamped onto the saw table using a hand operated, pneumatic or hydraulic <a href=\"//trademachines.com/maschinenschraubstoecke\"><strong>vice</strong></a>. A stop is used to ensure a high level of accuracy in repeated length measurements. The machine’s saw clamp is loaded on the side and guides the sawing and lifting movement of the saw blade; the lifting movement occur in the opposite direction of the cutting movement. Almost all materials can be cut using a hacksaw, and power hack saws are often used to saw steel bars. When sawing metal, a pipe or other construction for the supply of cooling agent, is available to ensure that the workpiece and saw blade remain cool.</p> <p>The hacking saw is mainly used in machine and steel construction, for<strong> cutting workpieces into the required length.</strong> A common method is to choose dimensions that are somewhat bigger than the dimensions of the finished workpiece. This allows for the work piece to be cut into the desired length during finishing touches using a lathe or milling machine. One example is cutting tool steel for trapezoidal screws, which are used in many different machine tools.</p> <h2>Who discovered the potential of the hacksaw and established themselves as a manufacturer of hacksaws?</h2> <p>There is an enormous demand for industrial hacksaws in the big industry branches of machine and steel construction. Those who have specialised themselves in producing hacksaws include MITTWEIDA, KASTO, BEHRINGER, STANDARD, SAW, WMW, and WEISEL. The hacksaw has continued to be developed since the time of the ancient Egyptians in order to be optimised to suit all kinds of materials and current scientific knowledge.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13564\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/dwht205471.jpg\" alt=\"dwht20547 hacksaw\" width=\"1032\" height=\"667\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"1372_en","content":"<h2>The structure and function of a metal cutting circular saw</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6938\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6938\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/circular_saw-225x300-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Metal cutting saw\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">High speed circular saw</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>All hand-held <strong>circular saws</strong>, and even most machine tools, can only undertake discontinuous sawing operations. These metal circular saws require an idle stroke for every working stroke. <strong>The cut is restricted by the length of the saw blade</strong>, after which the saw blade needs to move in the other direction and be guided back to the starting position. There are only a few saws and saw blades that can be used in both directions. The circular saw does not have this restriction because it has a seemingly infinitely long saw blade. When looking at the typology of machine tools, <strong>the circular saw is somewhat derived from the <a href=\"//trademachines.com/milling-machines\">milling machine</a></strong>. The circular saw blade is, in principle, a thinner rolling mill with a larger diameter. The disadvantage of this is the depth to which the metal cutting circular saw blades are inserted in the cut. For this reason, <strong>circular saw for sale</strong> can only produce particularly straight cuts. Due to the continual operation, small circular saws usually are able to produce a very even cut.</p>\r\n<h2>History and Development From a Small Circular Saw to a Circular Saw Table</h2>\r\n<p>Different types and designs of circular saws and their areas of applicationThe invention of the <strong>circular saw</strong> cannot be historically confirmed. It appears in patents from the 18th century, but is not patented itself. Therefore, it must have been around earlier. The steam engines at the beginning of the 19th century provided enough power to drive the <strong>very large circular saws</strong> in <a href=\"//trademachines.com/saw-mill\"><strong>sawmills</strong></a>, which had saw blades with diameters of up to 3 metres. The hand-held circular saw was based on an invention from 1923 and led to the company SKILSAW being founded.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6940\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6940\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/full_automatic_circular_saw-225x300-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Automatic circular saw for metal\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fully automated metal saw</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Due to their continuous method of operation, an <strong>electric circular saw</strong> has a higher average level of power than saws that change their direction of movement, like <a href=\"//trademachines.com/hack-saw\"><strong>hacksaws</strong></a>. Circular saw blades are only suited for straight cuts, and so they are used in all areas where a particularly <strong>high cutting performance</strong> <strong>and a precise, straight cut</strong> is required. There are hand-held, battery-powered circular saws available for using on the go. Special types of <strong>hand circular saw</strong> are<strong> used for cutting cement, asphalt or natural stones</strong>. If a higher level of cutting power is required, e.g. on construction sites, then circular saw benches can be used. With this type of device, the saw is fixed onto a work table, called <strong>circular saw table</strong>, and the saw blade protrudes through the table's panel from the bottom. With a <a href=\"//trademachines.com/panel-saw\"><strong>panel saw</strong></a>, the workpiece moves into a guide that is usually put into the exact position required using the help of built-in scales. For particularly hard materials, a circular saw blade with diamond-studded teeth can be used.

The grinding wheel is mounted on a horizontal spindle and cuts on its periphery as it contacts the work piece. It is the most widely used surface grinder and they are capable of accommodating very smaller to large work parts.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Vertical spindle and reciprocating table</strong> – The grinding operation is similar to that of face milling on a vertical milling machine. In this machine a cup shaped wheel grinds the work piece over its full width using end face of the wheel. When compared to the previous type of peripheral grinding, higher material removal rate can be achieved using this machine as it brings more grits into action. Bedways of an engine lathe and other long and narrow castings are most suited for grinding in this machine.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Horizontal spindle and rotary table</strong> – In this type of surface grinder, the work piece rotates 360 degrees on a rotary table underneath the wheelhead. The wheelhead moves across the work piece to provide the necessary cross feed movements. But there is an inherent limitation in the usage of this machine, it is not capable of grinding larger jobs. However, by swivelling the worktable, concave, convex or tapered surface grinding services can be produced on individual part.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Vertical spindle and rotary table</strong> – Vertical spindle machines use cup, cylinder, or segmented wheels. Many of these machines are equipped with two or more grinding heads to successively rough, semi-finish, and finish large castings, forgings, and welded fabrications in one rotation of the work table.

In gear form cutting, the cutting edge of the cutting tool has a shape identical with the shape of the space between the gear teeth. Form milling &amp; Broaching are the gear forming processes. In gear generating, the tooth flanks are generated as an outline of the subsequent positions of the cutter, which resembles in shape the mating gear in the gear pair as in gear hobbing &amp; gear shaping. Gear hobbing is a machining process in which gear teeth are progressively generated by a series of cuts with a helical multi point cutting tool called as <strong>hob</strong>. Hobbing is the most preferred industrial process for cutting gear teeth than any other teeth forming processes. Almost teeth of all types of gears like spur, helical, worm, sometimes special forms are cut using hobbing machines. The hob and the gear blank rotate continuously just as in the meshing of two gears until all teeth of the gear blank are cut.</p> <h2>Cutting Principle</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_8858\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8858\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/ghm-4-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"Hob after forming\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workpiece after forming process with hob in backround</figcaption></figure> <p>The cutting of a gear with a hobbing machine is a continuous operation and four to five teeth can be cut at a time on a <strong>progressive basis</strong>. To start cutting a gear, the rotating hob is fed inward until the proper setting for tooth depth is achieved, then cutting continues until the entire gear is finished. A <strong>proportional feed rate</strong> is always maintained between the gear blank and hob. The metal is removed from the blank as the hob generates the tooth form. The generating process requires an accurate relationship between various elements of the machine in order to achieve the desired results. The work table rotates in a definite relationship with the rotation of the hub. <strong>Index change gears</strong> are responsible for the timing of this relation. But in the case of hobbing helical gears, the rotation of the work table is slightly advanced or retarded in relation to the rotation of the axial feed screw with the help of another set of change gears namely <strong>differential change gears.</strong></p> <h2>Hobbing vs Shaping</h2> <p>Gear hobbing and shaping are the two major gear generating processes as discussed above. Hobbing produces a <strong>series of radial flats</strong> based on feed rate of hob across the work while shaping produces a series of straight lines parallel to the axis of the gear. The accuracy of the resultant gears produced by hobbing is with respect to <strong>tooth spacing and runout</strong> whereas it depends on the tooth form in the case of shaping. Stacking can make hobbing faster than shaping even for gears with narrow face widths. But narrow width jobs can be generated in lesser times with high speed stroking in gear shaping. Hobbing has a major disadvantage of not able to machine internal gears when compared to its counterpart.</p> <h2>Types of Hobbing Machines</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_8860\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8860\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/ghm-2-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"Tangential feed hobbing\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hobbing with tangential feed and fluid for cooling</figcaption></figure> <p>The <strong>gear hobbing process</strong> can be classified into three different types according to the directions of feeding the hob for gear cutting as:</p> <p><strong>Hobbing with Axial Feed:</strong> In this process the gear hob is fed against the gear blank along the face of the blank and parallel to its axis. This kind of feed is used mainly for making spur and helical gears.</p> <p><strong>Hobbing with Radial Feed:</strong> The hob and gear blanks are set with their axis normal to each other in this method. The rotating hob is fed against the gear blank in radial direction or at right angles to the axis of the gear blank. Worm wheels are made predominantly using this method of feeding.</p> <p><strong>Hobbing with Tangential Feed:</strong> In this kind of feeding, the hob is held with its axis horizontal but perpendicular to the axis of the gear blank. The hob is set at full depth of the tooth and then fed forward axially. Thus, the hob is fed tangential to the face of gear blank.</p> <h2>Advantages and Limitations</h2> <p>Some of the prominent advantages of the process of gear hobbing machines are: Gear hobbing is a fast and continuous process so it is realized as economical process as compared to other gear generation processes like shaping. It involves <strong>lower production cycle time</strong> thereby leading to <strong>higher productivity</strong>. The process is capable of making a wide variety of gears like spur gear, helical gears, worms, worm gears, splines, sprockets, etc. Indexing process is highly simplified and any number of teeth with consistent accuracy and precision can be made with ease. Also the <strong>indexing process is continuous</strong> and there is <strong>no intermittent motion</strong> subsequently eliminating the rise of errors. Gear hobbing is the exclusive process used for generating a special type of gear called <strong>harringbone gear</strong>. It is highly suitable for both batch and mass production. Several gear blanks, mounted on the same arbor, can be processed simultaneously which leads to cycle time reduction.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8862\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8862\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/ghm-1-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"Gear hobbing machine \" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hobbing machine with its control panel</figcaption></figure> <p>Because of the nature and profile of the hob, there is <strong>no overheating</strong> of the cutting tool as there is ample amount of time available to dissipate the heat. In addition to above mentioned various advantages, one of the major limitation of the process of gear hobbing is that the manufacturing of internal gears is not possible. Some of the splines and serrations require one tooth blocked or removed, which cannot be generated in a<strong> gear hobbing machine. </strong>If you are looking for buying used hobbing machines then look no further, start your search for hobbing machines for sale on Trade Machines metalworking machines auction.  Its easy to select and compare the hob machine from other manufacturers with the specs provided.</p> <h2>Manufacturers of Hobbing Machines</h2> <p>Some of the leading <strong>gear hobbing machine manufacturers</strong> in the world are: EMAG Maschinenfabrik, MAG, Gleason, STROJIRNY CELAKOVICE, Kashifuji, TOS a.s, FELSOMAT, Vanguard Machinery International, Drake manufacturing Services, Monnier &amp; Zahner AG and Affolter<strong>.</strong></p>"},{"id":"1398_en","content":"<h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Definition of a keyseating machine</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A keyseating machine is a<strong> cutting machine tool</strong>, used to produce <strong>internal grooves</strong> in hollow profiles. It is used when a lathe or milling machine cannot be used.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">The function of a keyseater</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A keyseating machine works along a vertical, linear movement and uses a<strong> one-sided draw knife</strong> for cutting. This removes material off the workpiece bit by bit using an even, downward motion. The width of the groove is determined by the corresponding ground knife. The depth of the groove is determined by the number of strokes. This is why these machines are related to planers. A keyseater is used to create uniform grooves on particularly tight hollow profiles. The form-fitting connection between the knife and the workpiece creates an exact and uniform cutting movement. They are very precise machines; their axes are particularly parallel. The one-sided draw knife uses a<strong> cutting, rather than a machining process</strong>, which ensures a particularly <strong>high quality surface</strong>.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Areas of application of keyseating machines</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">These internal grooves are created for <strong>full floating axles, carriers and springs</strong>. Another use is the uniform and simultaneous production of internal grooves in a row of workpieces. When simultaneously processing several workpieces in one machine, there is a particularly high level of consistency between the created geometries. Gear teeth and full floating axles are typical components, whose internal grooves are produced using keyseating machines.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">The structure of a keyseating machine</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The advantage of these machines is that they have a very compact construction. Contrary to expansive<strong> <a href=\"//trademachines.com/drehmaschinen\">lathes</a></strong> or voluminous <a href=\"//trademachines.com/fraesmaschinen\"><strong>milling machines</strong></a>, most keyseating machines are no bigger than <strong>2 meters squared</strong>. A cover is mounted upon a square base frame made out of either a<strong> welded or grey cast iron construction</strong>. On top of the cover there is the work table with a clamping device and the tool guide. The machine can be adjusted. This means: the single sided <strong>cutting knife</strong> is built in; the feed and the speed of the stroke are adjusted; the workpiece is put into place and clamped in; and then the process is started. Once it has started, the cutting work is done almost independently. Contrary to lathes or milling machines, a keyseating machine can have a high rotation speed. Therefore, their processes do not result in any flying chippings. Therefore, keyseating machines can usually be used without a cover or extraction systems. A <strong>cooling lubricant</strong> extends the working life of the cutting tool. Due to the minimal processing speed, keyseating does not produce as high of temperatures as turning and milling processes. However, the development of heat can lead to expansion of the cutting head and workpiece’s materials. This results in a loss of quality and a high level of wear and tear. Therefore, the use of a cooling lubricant is required for every keyseating process. Keyseaters work either <strong>mechanically, hydraulically or by using ball screws</strong>. Keyseating machines are not as flexible as lathes or milling machines in processing workpieces. They only undertake their one task – the production of grooves – but with a high level of precision and safety. They are most suited for facilities, which have a high requirement for keyseating processes. Here, <strong>keyseating machines</strong> can be used in the machine parks instead of milling machines and lathes.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Working with a keyseating machine</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Despite the fact that they can run independently, keyseating machines are more suited for trained cutting machine operators, rather than assistants. If untrained assistants, or those who are new to the field, want to use a keyseater machine, and particularly a used keyseater, it is necessary that they undertake training. This is particularly important for work safety and quality assurance. Monitoring the produced dimensions is just as important during series production of components, as it is on other cutting machines. The cutting blades wear out continuously, which leads to the tolerances not being met. Internal groves are mainly used for <strong>constructive and dynamic components</strong>. Faulty tolerances can be visible in the construction because the built-in components can <strong>jam</strong> when the machine heats up. These can then only be dismantled if destructed. If the customer discovers the incorrect dimensions for the specified tolerances, then the manufacturer of the components could receive high recourse claims. Therefore, it is important to continually monitor the quality. Since the blades wear out relatively continuously, regular <strong>spot tests</strong> are enough to notice if the tolerances no longer fit in time. The keyseating process usually ends up forming <strong>burrs</strong> along its output points. These are very sharp and pose a high risk of injury and damage. Therefore, it is usually required to have a deburring stage during the keyseating process. Usually a standard drilling machine with a grinding head or a hand-held grinding machine is enough. This work is typically undertaken by trained assistants.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Just like all cutting machines, keyseaters produce a large amount of waste. This needs to be continuously removed and properly disposed of. <strong>The chippings</strong> are very sharp, and should only be handled when wearing gloves. If cooling lubricants are used, it is necessary to clean the produced component. If there is no cleaning station, this task can be undertaken by assistants.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">The efficiency of a keyseating machine</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The keyseating process is slower than turning or milling work. This is due to the linear movement of the cutting knife, which can only be used on one side. The upward movement of the keyseating machine always occurs on an<strong> idle stroke</strong>. This reduces the speed of the keyseater machine by another factor. Large keyseating machines reach speeds of up to 20-48m/min. However, this is not comparable to the high speeds of<a href=\"//trademachines.com/fraesen-stemmen-drehen\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> lathes and milling machines</strong></a>. The main advantages of these machines are that they can <strong>work independently</strong> and<strong> do not require much space.</strong> Therefore, they are suited to use the available space as efficiently as possible during mechanical production. If a company uses a high number of components with internal grooves, it is a very useful option to use several keyseating machines.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Keyseating machine manufacturers</h3> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Keyseaters for sale are special machines, which are not available from the established machine manufacturers. Keyseating machines are products made by specialist companies, which are highly experienced and provide an excellent level of quality. Particularly recommended suppliers are TGW, WGW, STUHLMANN, BALZAT, FRÖMAG, MARIO BEYER, CHRISTIAN GIERTH and the LEISTRITZ GROUP.</p>"},{"id":"1403_en","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">What is an End Finishing Machine? </h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">An end finishing machine is one which is used for finishing ends of bars and tubes with various levels of sophistication and automation. There are machines available in the market which have the capability to finish more than 1500 ends per hour. Simultaneous inside-outside deburring, chamfering and facing are possible in end finishing machines. </p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Types of End Finishing Machines </h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">End finishing machines are classified into two types based on their application as: Bar end finishing machine and Tube end finishing machine. In the case of tube end finishing machines, the operator slides the tube into the machine collet, and if necessary locks it down and advances a lever to bring the cutter in contact with the tube ends. Some machines are bench top, some are standalone devices while some need a small platform under them to allow proper height for the operator to work on. Bar end finishing machines usually work the same way as tube finishing machines. Some may lack clamp-down and precision sizing capabilities. These machines can also be constructed with stiff brushes instead of cutters to perform the deburring and edge rounding which can be used to remove saw cut burrs. </p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Working with an End Finishing Machine </h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The operator of the end finishing machine places the work piece through the self-centering chuck against an adjustable stop and pulls the starting lever. This action closes the chuck, pivots the stop clear and feeds the work to the rotating cutters. One of the cutter scrapes the outside edge, one cutter scrapes the inner edge and one more cutter scrapes against the flat end to remove any burrs caused by the other rotating cutters. On some of the end finishing machines, the rotating cutter is mounted on the same spindle as an abrasive cut-off saw. In operation, the work piece is sawn to length and then fed into the cutters. Double end machines are also widely available to deburr, chamfer and face both ends of the tubes, rods or pipes at rates of about 2000 work pieces (4000 ends) per hour. Some machines are integrated into transfer lines using magazine, cradle loading, unloading and storage devices.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">End Finishing Machine Manufacturers</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Manufacturers of end finishing machines are for instance AMANN Werkzeugmaschinen GmbH, GEORG FISCHER, HECKERT or BAIER.

It plays a pivotal role in manufacturing where a superior blend of material properties is required. Heat treatment process can be defined as an operation or combination of operations involving <strong>heating</strong> at a definite temperature, <strong>soaking</strong> for a particular period of time and <strong>cooling</strong> at some specified rate. The primary objective of heat treatment is to increase the service life of a product by altering its mechanical properties like strength, ductility, toughness, wear resistance, hardness, etc. and prepare the material for improved manufacturability. The change in the metal properties can be attributed to the phase transformations and the micro structural changes which take place during heat treatment services.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_7665\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7665\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/hte-300x136.jpg\" alt=\"heat treatment furnace\" width=\"300\" height=\"136\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Metal is put in a heat treatment furnace for heating</figcaption></figure> <h2>Stages of Heat Treatment</h2> <p>Industrial heat treating operation involves the following three basic stages irrespective of the type of process.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Heating </strong>- The metal is heated slowly to ensure uniform temperature throughout the surface. If uneven heating occurs, one section of a part can expand faster than another resulting in distortion or cracking. The heating rate depends mainly on the heat conductivity of the material.</li> <li><strong>Soaking - </strong>After the metal is heated to a specified temperature, it is held for a particular period of time at that temperature for the desired internal structural changes to take place. The length of time, called as the soaking period depends on the chemical analysis of the part and the weight of the metal treated.</li> <li><strong>Cooling – </strong>The metal is cooled to room temperature after soaking period to complete the heat treatment process. To cool the metal, it can be placed in contact with a cooling medium such as air, water, oil etc. The rate of cooling depends on the metal and the properties desired.</li> </ul> <p>Some of the basic heat treatment processes are discussed below.</p> <h3>Annealing</h3> <p>Annealing is the process of <strong>heating a metal to a specific temperature, holding it at that temperature for a definite length of time, and then cooling the metal to room temperature.</strong> Metals are annealed to relieve internal stresses, soften them and make them more ductile. To produce maximum softness, the metal must be cooled slowly which is ensured by burying the hot part in sand, ashes, or some other substance that does not conduct heat readily or by allowing the furnace and part to cool together called as furnace cooling.</p> <h3><strong>Normalizing</strong></h3> <figure id=\"attachment_7669\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7669 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/hte-4-300x130.jpg\" alt=\"electric normalizing machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"130\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Normalizing of steel</figcaption></figure> <p>Normalizing is almost similar to annealing except that the metal is cooled using still air at a faster rate after soaking period. Normalizing is <strong>less expensive than annealing and also normalized steels are harder and stronger than annealed steels</strong>. In fact highest degree of hardness can be achieved by normalizing among the other heat treatment processes. But the primary purpose of normalizing is to remove the internal stresses induced by <strong>heat treatment machines</strong>, welding, casting, forging, forming, or machining.</p> <h3><strong>Hardening</strong></h3> <p>Hardening is basically the opposite of annealing. A metal is hardened by heating it to a higher temperature, holding the same for a set time and then cooling it suddenly. <strong>The rapid cooling is achieved by plunging the material into quench media such as water, oil, brine solution etc.</strong> Hence, hardening is also called as quenching as the metal at higher temperature is brought immediately to room temperature by immersing it in cooling medium. It increases the hardness and strength of the material but at the same time it adversely affects the brittleness.</p> <h3><strong>Tempering</strong></h3> <p>Tempering is <strong>usually performed after hardening as rapid cooling of the metal results in high amount of internal stresses</strong>. Also it reduces the brittleness and increases the ductility of the hardened material.Tempering involves heating of metal to a lower critical temperature (much lower than the hardening temperature) and then cooling at a prescribed rate. Heating temperature majorly influences the hardness of the material, higher the temperature softer the metal. The rate of cooling hardly affects the microstructure of the metal.</p> <h3><strong>Heat Treatment Equipment</strong></h3> <figure id=\"attachment_7667\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7667 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/hte-2-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"steel hardening machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Electrical machine for hardening steel</figcaption></figure> <p>The equipment required for the process <strong>heat treatment furnaces</strong> or other heat treating machines such as induction heat treating equipment, quenching baths or other cooling devices, temperature controls and other indicators required for the proper operation of the equipment or for the control of the process.

Veneer made out of high-end wood is characterised through its <strong><strong>easy maintenance and robust surface. </strong></strong>The most commonly used material for veneer is<strong><strong> precious wood, </strong></strong>followed by <strong><strong>maple, cherry, birch and pine</strong></strong>. Precious veneer is made out of <strong><strong>teak, mahogany, vavona, black walnut, yew and padouk</strong></strong>. This veneer is a particularly high-quality product and expensive. Even though the base material of veneered components are not valuable (sometimes even chipboard is used), veneer is used to transform them into high-end products. With the right level of maintenance, they can last as long as products made out of solid wood. Damaged products that no longer have the aesthetic quality required, e.g. that have peeling or splintered veneer, can be refurbished using reparation veneer. This is particularly the case for edge strips, which can easily repair a damaged surface. These veneer strips are available at all hardware stores and have a thermally active adhesive material on one side. With an iron they can be used to fix damaged shelves, window ledges, or door edges. For these uses and industrial applications, the veneer panels need to be precisely cut. A veneer saw is used for this purpose.</p> <h2><strong>Veneer saws – From a hand-held tool to an industrial machine </strong></h2> <p>The simplest veneer saw is a special hand knife, which a skilled worker can use to produce <strong><strong>a single cut in the veneer</strong></strong>. How to use this type of knife is part of the training given to become a cabinet maker, carpenter, stair and window maker. There are special veneer saws available in industry to cut veneer for coating series products. These cannot be compared to other saw machines in the woodworking industry. Every component of a veneer saw machine is design to achieve <strong><strong>the highest level of precision. </strong></strong>Exact stops, precise adjustments and a stable stance during the cutting process are the basic requirements of best veneer saw. The highest quality veneer saws also have CNC-controlled assembly of the entire surface. Using these machines, veneer with gaps, oblong holes, radii and inlays can be mass-produced with a uniform quality.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11496\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11496 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/Veneer-Saw-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"automatic veneer saw\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fully automatic veneer saw at work</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>The structure of a veneer saw</strong></h2> <p>A machine veneer saw is made out of a particularly <strong><strong>large work table, a clamping device, a guide and a saw. </strong></strong>The work table can easily be over<strong><strong> five meters long and three meters wide</strong></strong>. The veneer sheet is guided by the stop and cut into the desired dimensions. The clamping device holds the sheet in place during the cutting process. The saw drives along the guide and cuts the veneer sheet into the desired width. Through the turning of the veneer sheet, the thin veneer saw is used to cut the product into the desired width.</p> <h2><strong>Working with a veneer saw</strong></h2> <p>Veneer can be an expensive product, particularly when it has been produced out of high-quality wood. The optimal utilisation of available space is a key requirement when working with a veneer saw. This is achieved by using particularly narrow saw blades, which help to minimise the cut. With intelligent planing, the waste that occurs when processing a veneer sheet can be kept to a minimum. The operator needs to have the necessary awareness of the high-quality materials they are working with, even if the work only requires <strong>hanging up the material and starting</strong> the cutting process. Taking care when loading, operating and planing the cuts, can significantly increase the efficiency of a veneer saw.</p> <p>High-end CNC veneer cutting machines contain numerous processing opportunities for the veneer sheets. The programming of these machines are undertaken by specially trained workers.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11499\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11499 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/thin-veneer-saw-300x146.jpg\" alt=\"extraction system of a veneer saw\" width=\"300\" height=\"146\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Veneer saw with integrated extraction system</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>Accessories for veneer saws</strong></h2> <p>Even though thin veneer saws do not produce as many chippings as <a href=\"//trademachines.com/milling-morticing-turning\"><strong>milling machines</strong></a><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong> </strong></span></strong>or <a href=\"//trademachines.com/lathes\"><strong>lathes</strong></a>, these machines are also capable of creating a lot of dirt. Working with a veneer saw requires a <strong><strong>daily and thorough clean. </strong></strong>The life span of the saw knife can be significantly increased, if it is properly cleaned. With an integrated extraction system, a large amount of the contaminants can be immediately removed. Inaccessible areas are ideally cleaned using a compressed air gun.</p> <p><strong>The quality of the cut depends on how sharp the saw is.</strong> If the saw is beginning wear out, then the operator will be able to hear this. If a dull knife is neglected for too long, then this will negatively impact the precision of the cut. The cutting process then turns into more of a ripping process, which creates an unsightly and irregular contour on the on the cutting edge. This can end up ruining the entire veneer sheet. The veneer saw blade needs to be regularly monitored, replaced and sharpened when necessary.</p> <p>Waste material often leads to very bulky veneer strips that take up a lot of space. If these are not properly disposed of, it can quickly lead to transportation problems. Special machines have been developed to avoid this problem. <strong>The veneer chipper cuts up the veneer strips into small fragments, that can easily fit into a waste container.</strong></p> <p><strong><strong>Uncoated veneer waste </strong></strong>is a natural product, which can still be used. The chipboard industry can use these waste products to produce course chipboard. The pellet industry can create high-quality pellets, which are used in pellet ovens. Finally, they are a good material to use in normal incinerators for energy recovery. Responsibly disposing of waste material can significantly reduce the disposal costs of a facility.</p> <h2><strong>Buying a used veneer saw</strong></h2> <p>Finding a used, well-maintained veneer saw is not a problem. The most common areas where it would be worn out are on the <strong><strong>mobile components, </strong></strong>like the saw guide. These components can be usually be <strong>ordered and replaced </strong>by high-end manufacturers. There are a number of special companies available for refurbishing and maintaining used machines.</p> <h2><strong>Suppliers of veneer saws</strong></h2> <p>The companies ULMIA, CIRCUM and WOODPECKER offer hand-held veneer saws. High-end veneer saws for processing veneer sheets are available from the companies OTTO MEYER MASCHINENFABRIK, SCHEER, HANDL, BAIER, LANGZAUNER and BOEDECKER. Particularly good veneer saws with CNC-control are available from the company CASATI.</p> <p></p>"},{"id":"1444_en","content":"<h3>Veneer Processing Machines</h3> <p>Veneer is peeled from solid wood. The first step of veneer production is to use a wood saw to saw the logs into equally-dimensioned pieces. After they have been sawn, the bark is taken off of the logs by a special type of lathe.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_27357\" style=\"width: 551px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-27357\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/Veneer-Faces-Trimming-and-Reinforcing-Machine.jpg\" alt=\"Veneer Faces Trimming and Reinforcing Machine\" width=\"551\" height=\"372\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Veneer Faces Trimming and Reinforcing Machine</figcaption></figure> <p>Removing the bark is the last step of the peeling process. Special veneer peeling machines which are one of those <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/wood\">woodworking machinery</a></strong> which uses long blades to separate the veneer sheets from a rotating wooden log. With hydraulically or electrically powered feeds, the peeling blade produces the required power to cut veneer sheets into equal thickness and quality. After it is peeled, the veneer ribbon is cut. The veneer is then dried, after which it is ready for further processing. The veneer is then made ready for use and transformed into a machine-processable shape, after which it can be applied.</p> <p>The veneer sheet is applied to laminar components by using a veneer press. The base material is first coated with glue and then, by using a high level of pressure, the veneer sheet is tightly pressed upon it. This ensures that there is a permanent bond. The edges of components, that will be veneered, pose a great challenge. Edge banding machines are used to prepare straight and right-angled edges on furniture panels, and apply the veneer strips to them. Soft forming machines also have the same function but they use soft pressure rollers. These fit unusually shaped edges and can even glue veneer strips to round corners. </p> <h3>Working of A Veneer Processing Machines</h3> <p>The waste that occurs from producing and processing veneer is transformed into manageable sizes using a veneer chipper. Veneer strips usually have the characteristic, that they are available on a slight diagonal in relation to their length; they are relatively unwieldy along their width. If the waste material from veneer production and processing is not cut up using the veneer chipper, then it would quickly clog up the bins, making disposal costs unnecessarily high. Veneer chippers are simple, robust and easy-to-use machines, which are only used to break-up veneer sheets. Working with a veneer processing machine is easy as it is processed and produced automatically. Workers are mainly required for monitoring, loading and maintenance.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_27358\" style=\"width: 793px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-27358\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/Crossfeed-Veneer-Splicer.jpg\" alt=\"Crossfeed Veneer Splicer\" width=\"793\" height=\"423\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crossfeed Veneer Splicer</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Veneer processing machines </strong>have many sharp knives, heavy, rotating machines components and high temperatures. The sheets produced from veneer processing machines themselves have very sharp edges and can lead to injury. Therefore, producing veneer is a dangerous line of work, where only workers who have been trained should be allowed to work. Veneer sheets in their rawest form are very robust. Due to their calculated cut, they are also not so sensitive to shocks. In their processed state, veneered workpieces are extremely sensitive. This is because once veneer has been applied to a product it can hardly be repaired. Scratches, dents and cuts in the veneer usually end up ruining the entire component. Therefore, a finished product always has to be handled with extreme care. Automated solutions are recommended for carefully handling finished products.</p> <p>Turning stations and industrial robots are ideal for palletizing furniture panels. First of all, the size and weight of the processed panels are insignificant. But robots can be used to ease the work of the operator, and prevent work-related injuries. Also, turning stations and industrial robots of veneer processing machines ensure uniform precision. The handling stages of these auxiliary machines can be designed to be particularly complex. Finally, vacuum lifters or rubber gripping arms are used to transport veneered panels.</p> <h3>Used Veneer Processing Machines</h3> <p>Used veneer processing machines is a popular solution for woodworking and wood processing businesses for unnecessary spending. Most used veneer processing machines manufacturers produce durable and long lasting machinery that whoever buys them can be assured that the machine will last for a long time. In addition, these machines are costly and therefore the owners treat the machines very  carefully and are well-taking care of.</p> <p></p> <h4>Veneer Processing Machines Manufacturers</h4> <p>A veneer processing machine can also be used in wide range of areas of operation for numerous companies. Sawing machines for cutting the logs are produced by BAUER SÄGEMASCHINEN, SCHLEICHER, BINDERBERGER and ARGOMASTER. Peeling machines for removing bark from cut logs are available from VALON-KRONE, MARIO FERRARI, SEGEM, ESTERER and MATELEST. The latter also has very good combined cutting and de-barking machine in their product range. Veneer peeling machines are available from BERTRAM and VON-BOELZIG.

These machines are widely used in all different types of plywood (panel), ply, block board &amp; woodwork to spread the glue uniformly on the core veneer &amp; face veneer. These machines ensures accurate and firm bonding of veneer edges with no visible joint line. Veneer glueing machines are equipped with the integrated glueing system inside. These machines are particularly suitable for the furniture industry and in making high end decorative plywood. After the well-cut veneers are aligned evenly by the synchronized in-feed rollers, the veneers are directly conveyed to the singular glueing unit for glueing edges and then transported to the heating section for glue curing. The veneer glueing and splicing processes can be accomplished within one single machine. Coupled with double knife veneer guillotines, a perfect veneer cutting and splicing work can also be achieved. Using these machines some of the problems of hand veneering with hot hide glue and other issues associated with pressing veneered work can be surpassed with ease. Veneer presses come in a variety of shapes and sizes and are to be carefully chosen depending upon the requirements. </p> <figure id=\"attachment_9870\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9870\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/06/veneer-gluing-machine.jpg\" alt=\"KUPER Veneer Glueing Machine\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Veneer Glueing Machine from KUPER</figcaption></figure> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Working with a Veneer Glueing Machine </h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The veneer glueing units are designed in such a way that they are capable of providing a precise and reliable veneer edges glueing output. Unlike in traditional hand glueing methods, the veneer package is placed vertically with pneumatic pressing mechanism from the two sides to avoid excessive or uneven glue applied onto veneer edges. This allows operators to have precise and even glue applied resulting in a seamless and clean jointing outcome. Coupled with veneers both cross-feed and longitudinal splicers, a perfect veneer splicing work can be achieved. The veneer trimming unit, is designed for providing a 90-degree jointing angle on the jointing face of veneer edges for the strongest bonding output. It follows the similar principle as glue applicator, the veneer package is placed vertically with pneumatic pressing mechanism from two sides followed by trimming. The trimming mechanism can be mounted together with the glue applicator resulting in a combination of glueing and trimming work resulting in high quality of splicing. </p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Advantages of Veneer Glueing Machines </h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Veneer glueing machines offer numerous advantages and a properly selected veneer glueing machine for a suitable product results in the following: </p> <ul style=\"text-align: justify\"> <li>Increased glue utilization </li> <li>Perfect spreading of the glue </li> <li>Minimum glue consumption </li> <li>Prevention of wastages </li> <li>recise sticking of Veneers</li> </ul> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Used Veneer Glueing Machines</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Manufacturers of veneer glueing machines are among others Heinrich KUPER, Werner FINNENKOETTER or FISCHER &amp; RUECKLE.

Machines performing this type of functioning are known as Veneer peeling machines. Rotary peeled and sliced veneers are both made by drawing sharp knives through the log cutting thin layers. Rotary peeled veneers are made by cutting in a circular motion from the outside of the log into the centre. Plane sliced veneers are cut length wise from one end of a log to the other end. These machines allow user to make peeling and cutting of veneer strips of given width simultaneously. To improve the performance and operator comfort machines are equipped with hydraulic lift, which allows to determine automatically the optimal rotational axis of the work piece and combine it with the rotational axis of centring shafts.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Types of Veneer Cutting</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">There are three different methods of cutting veneers sawing, slicing, half round slicing, and rotary peeling. For today peeling is the most common way to produce good quality veneers which are to undergo further processing. Rotary peeling is the most widely used method among the three different types as rotary peeling of veneers using a lathe accounts for nearly 95% of all veneer production. It is predominantly used in the manufacture of structural plywood.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Working of Veneer Peeling Machines</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Rotary peeling involves centring the log or bolt onto the lathe chuck. The log is slowly rotated and the knife carriage moved into the log. The knife then converts the bolt into a cylinder. In this process of rounding, various widths and lengths of wood (fishtails) are removed from the log surface. After rounding, the bolt revolves against the knife at a speed of above 420 km/min and spindle speed up to 200 rpm have been used on large lathes. At slower speeds vibration is likely to adversely affect the quality of veneer, producing a rough and corrugated surface. The gears feed the blade towards the bolt as its diameter is reduced, so that veneer is unwinding in a continuous ribbon. During the process of peeling, lathe checks can develop in the underside of the veneer, as the underside is subjected to tension during the peeling process. The side of the veneer in which checks occur is known as the loose side, whereas the other side free of checks is known as the tight side. The setting of the knife and nose bar pressure during peeling is important in reducing the formation of checks, and also in controlling veneer thickness. Each wood species requires certain nose bar pressure to minimise the development of lathe checks, however nose bar pressures are positively related to wood density.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Used Veneer Peeling Machines</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Manufacturers of veneer peeling machines are amongst others DANZER, VON BOELZIG or CREMONA.

Moreover, veneer waste resource may come in different shapes and sizes to the finest powder. Throughputs typically range between 300kg/hr. to 15,000kg/hr. depending on the model, material type and application.

Feeding single-shaft shredders can either be vertical using a hopper or horizontalwith a vibrating chute.</p><p><strong>Dual shaft shredders</strong></p><p> Two shaft shredders are used for applications that require a broad range of sizes and can be used as final processing or pre-processing prior to grinding or refining. Dual shaft shredders use two cutting shafts to provide finite size reduction for applications that do not require small, precision reductions. High performance blades provide efficient cutting, minimizing multiple passes through the shredder. These shredders can be integrated with pre- and post-shredding separators and grinders or refiners for further processing.</p><p><strong>Four shaft shredders</strong></p><p> The feeding of four-shaft shredders takes place vertically via the hopper. In contrast to twin-shaft shredders, four-shaft shredders can be equipped with a screen. This leads to a homogenous fraction size. The material is powerfully torn and shredded by the talons of the cuttings discs, then pressed through the cut grooves of the clearing discs and finally discharged through a screen which is mounted underneath the cuttings discs.</p><p><strong>SELECTION OF VENEER SHREDDERS</strong></p><p>Veneer shredders can be selected based on the following criteria: </p><p><strong>Reduction Ratio</strong></p><p> The reduction ratio refers to the amount of organic material that will be reduced after going through the machine. The reduction ratio should not be misinterpreted for power.</p><p><strong>Number of Blades</strong></p><p> A machine will run more efficiently with a high number of blades.

To invest the money better a tip could be to buy used packaging machinery for sale .</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Working at a packaging station</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Especially when working with small components, the amount produced is a factor that determines the success of the company. An efficient packaging system is a significant influence on the production and distribution volumes. Therefore, the packaging stations in the distribution department of a company are usually very well engineered, to avoid wasting valuable working time. The packaging process usually runs largely <strong>automatically</strong>,and if it is well organised, only requires a minimum amount of man power. The routine work required then restricts itself to the preparation of the empty pallets and the taking away of the palletised goods and transporting them to the lorry.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_7937\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7937 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/pm-2-300x141.jpg\" alt=\"buisquit packaging machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"141\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wrapping machine for cookies</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">With very well-engineered machines, the automated packaging equipment require a lot of maintenance. Packaging machines contain a very complex mechanical structure that is sensitive to contamination and disturbance. Trained assistants can learn the most important cleaning and interference-elimination functions on site. A professional, trained mechanic also has to be in the close vicinity of the packaging machine. The <strong>cleanliness </strong>around the general packaging equipment is incredibly important, especially for the food packaging machines. It is important to sweep and vacuum all dirty areas daily, and this can be done by trained assistants. This is particularly important for the food packaging equipment and the packaging of pharmaceutical products. When looking for a used packaging machine, it is important to check if this one is authorized for these important sectors. This is also the case for the entire assembly line, including the feed-in and loading systems. Well-maintained and cleaned packaging equipment can be used for years for this reason used packaging machines for sale are a considerable option.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Packaging Machine Manufacturers</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Shrink guns are the appropriate tool for ensuring the safe use of shrink wrap film and shrink hoods.

Once packaged, a <strong>pallet stacker</strong> or <strong>container stacker</strong> is then used to simply and conveniently move the boxed or packaged items to the delivery container or truck. Both <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/handling-packaging\">packaging and handling machines</a> </strong>minimise, or eliminate, the need for manual labour while helping to ensure that items are processed and finished according to specifications.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11528\" style=\"width: 327px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-11528\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/Feeder-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"vibrator feeder in a company\" width=\"327\" height=\"184\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vibrator feeding system</figcaption></figure> <h2>Vibratory Feeder</h2> <p>The most common form of feeder is that of the <strong>vibrating feeder</strong>, or vibrator feeder. Components are fed into a bowl, and are then <strong>subjected to vibrations</strong> <strong>that use the mechanical dimensions and shape of the components</strong> to deliver them for the next stage in the manufacturing process. Typically, this means that a <strong>conveyor chute is used</strong> that is designed for the specific shape of the component, and as they are vibrated into position, they will naturally turn and basically bounce into the proper alignment. The <strong>vibratory feeders</strong> chute then feed the components into another piece of manufacturing machinery, ensuring no manual sorting is required while also ensuring that the pieces are delivered where required and in the position that they are needed.</p> <h2>Screw Feeder</h2> <p>A screw feeder is <strong>used where the flow rate of the component being delivered needs to be closely managed and maintained at a uniform rate</strong>. Single <strong>screw feeders</strong> can be used for basic applications, but those with multiple sets of screws, which may or may not be cambered or tapered, can give greater control especially where the clumping of components may become an issue.</p> <h2>Component Handling</h2> <p>The components that are sorted during this process may be sent to an additional manufacturing process, or <strong>feeders can be used to sort the components into boxes, cartons, and packets ready for finishing and delivery</strong>. Once all of the components are packaged, <strong>stackers are usually used to move the container from the end of the manufacturing line to a storage area</strong>, or directly into containers ready to be shipped.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11534\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11534\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/Stacker-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"pallet stacker at work\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Automatic plastic pallet stacker</figcaption></figure> <h2>Manual Stacker Machine</h2> <p>A manual stacker requires that the operator walk with the machine, but <strong>stacker machine</strong> will collect the boxes or cartons, and take the load before the operator delivers them to the required area.

If the water is not removed, the wood can’t be used to produce a high quality finished product. The equipment that is used for drying wood is termed as <strong>wood drying machinery </strong>or<strong> wood drying equipment</strong>. Properly <strong>dried wood</strong> sells for a higher price and is much easier to work with than wood that hasn’t been dried. When wood is dried right and suitably stocked in <strong>wood drying rack </strong>afterwards, it machines better, glues better, and finishes better. Drying also improves the strength of the wood, kills infestations, hardens pitch, preserves colour, reduces weight and controls shrinkage. Wood that is not dried under controlled <strong>wood drying methods</strong> is prone to warping, staining, and other degrade that diminishes its selling price and workability.</p> <h3>Classification of Woods based on Drying</h3> <p>The timbers are classified as follows according to their ease of drying: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Highly refractory woods:</strong> These woods are slow and difficult to dry if the final product is to be free from defects, particularly cracks and splits. They require considerable protection and care against rapid drying conditions to obtain best results. </li> <li><strong>Moderately refractory woods:</strong> These timbers show a moderate tendency to crack and split during seasoning. They can be seasoned free from defects under moderately rapid <strong>drying conditions</strong>. </li> <li><strong>Non-refractory woods:</strong> These woods can be rapidly seasoned to be free from defects even by applying high temperatures in an industrial <strong>wood drying kiln</strong>.</li> </ul> <h3>Working of Wood Drying Machinery</h3> <p><figure id=\"attachment_27314\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-27314 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/06/Rotary-Wood-Chips-Dryer--300x175.jpg\" alt=\"Rotary Wood Chips Dryer\" width=\"300\" height=\"175\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rotary Wood Chips Dryer</figcaption></figure></p> <p>The main aim of a <strong>wood dryer</strong> is to increase the thermal value of wood. In the process of drying, the removal of moisture out of materials is carried out by means of exhalation and withdrawal of generated streams. All <strong>wood dryers</strong> are classified, generally by the ways of warmth admission to the surface of the drying materials. There are contact, convection, radiation, sublimation, high-frequency and combined dryers. Convection dryers are more effective for dispersed materials as a desiccative agent has a continuous contact with wood. Depending on the material characteristics and the size of fragments, there are different constructions of the dryers drumming, belt, with a “boiling” layer, aero fountain and others. The speed of drying process depends on the temperature of the <strong>wood drying kiln machinery</strong>, relevant speed of its moving, specific surface of the drying fragments and physical characteristics of the material. At the beginning of the drying process, the humidity of the material is constant to a larger extent. After a certain period of <strong>wood drying time</strong> when the concentration of moisture at the material surface goes down as the result of exhalation, the period of falling drying speed and the temperature of the material begins to increase. As moisture content goes down the temperature of the dryable fragments approximates to the temperature of a desiccative agent. Thus, there are some limits for the temperature of the used desiccative agent in connection with the possibility of fine dispersed dry wood fragments ignition.</p>"},{"id":"1509_en","content":"<div>For an efficient and convenient woodworking unit, <strong>a combination woodworking machine combines many tools on one adjustable table</strong>.</div> <figure id=\"attachment_9768\" style=\"width: 278px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-9768\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/combination-woodworking-machine.jpg\" alt=\"woodworking combination machine after processing wood\" width=\"278\" height=\"154\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Combination machine for the woodworking process in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <h2>Overview of Combination Machines for Woodworking</h2> <div>A combination woodworking machine is a unit that combines more than one functional tool or device for <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/wood\">woodworking machinery</a></strong>.

The smallest containers can be as small as only a few meters squared. The largest containers are the voluminous <strong>shipping containers</strong>. As there are many types of teel containers, to search used shipping containers for sale are an intelligent option or simply used storage containers choosing a specific container. <strong>Industrial storage containers</strong> are used for general cargo, bulk cargo, liquids, gases and gas containers. Ideally, packaging and steel containers are usually designed to fit one another. This guarantees an efficient use of space.</p> <h3>Open-front storage containers</h3> <p>Open-front storage containers are the <strong>smallest standardized containers</strong>, which are consistently used. The are made out of folded and welded steel sheets, deep-drawn or cast aluminium, or injection-moulded polystyrene. They are used for safely storing small products like screws, springs, clasps and clips. They are mainly implemented in manual workshops, where delicate products are assembled. <strong>Open-front storage containers</strong> are open at the top and skewed towards the front. They have a slip-in window at the back for a label. The material of the container is slightly folded around the bottom. This means that open-front storage containers of the same size can be easily stacked. <strong>These types of containers are always very light; they can be carried by hand.</strong> Mechanical <a href=\"//trademachines.com/lifting-device\"><strong>lifting devices</strong></a> are not needed for open-front storage containers. They are usually moved between a material container and the workplace. They are permanently open which means that they are <strong>not suited for the long-term storage of products</strong>, they would quickly be contaminated. If open-front storage containers are used for the permanent storage of small goods, then it is recommended to use a sealed bag for protection. This is easy to clean and effectively prevents dirt or contaminants from reaching small components.</p> <h3>Freight Containers - Shipper Container</h3> <p>Freight containers differentiate themselves from open-front storage containers, in that they have a <strong>continuous edge</strong>. They are designed to be used for the intermediary storage of materials and are well suited for bulk materials.<strong> Freight containers</strong> can be made out of plastic, sheet metal or wood. They have two handles, which makes them easy to transport. They can be heavily loaded, if additional aids like carts or hand trucks are available. A <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/cranes\">crane</a> </strong>or machine jack can be used to lift the freight container from the cart onto the work table. Suitable slings need to be implemented when transporting the freight containers to <strong>great heights or over long distances</strong>.</p> <h3>Transport crates and transport boxes</h3> <p>These containers are bigger than stackable containers. Transport crates can also be locked. Both types of containers are very stably built and are made out of high-end material, just like stacking containers and open-front storage bins. <strong>Transporting crates and boxes</strong> are rarely made out of plastic. Thick-walled aluminium is usually used for light containers. Cheaper, but heavier and more robust variations are made out of welded steel. The containers need to be additionally palletized, if they are going to be stored for a long period of time.</p> <h3>Transport Steel Containers</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_7341\" style=\"width: 600px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7341\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/shipping_container_1.jpg\" alt=\"transport container for shipping\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shipper Container for worldwide transport</figcaption></figure> <p>Even though, strictly speaking, transport or shipping boxes and crates can also be containers, the term is usually used for the <strong>type of container that is transported with</strong> <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/forklifts\">forklifts</a></strong>. This includes <strong>steel containers</strong>, or <strong>metal storage containers</strong>, and pallet cages. Plastic storage containers and stacking boxes generally have the identical dimensions of a pallet and are 500-600 mm tall. They are restricted in their height, in order to prevent overloading and to ensure that loading and unloading them is always easy. They are made completely out of corrugated steel, which means that they cannot be easily damage. These damages could have otherwise occurred from external shocks or from the goods slipping around inside. They have four welded corners on the top. These corners all have eyelets, through which a crane hook can be attached. These corners are designed so that the plastic storage containers can be stacked using a forklift or crane. The feet of a <strong>plastic storage container</strong> is specially designed to fit the pallet's dimensions. Thereby, they can be stored into the corresponding, stably-built pallet shelves. <strong>Plastic storage containers</strong> are the most stable type of storage container and can host loads of up to 1,500kg. They are suited to carry bulky materials and <strong>usually do not have a lid</strong>. If required, these are available within the industry. This is also usually necessary due to the types of products that are stored. Bulk materials like sand, granules, grit or salt are typically stored in large plastic storage containers. Metal goods like screws, fittings and unimportant machine components can also be stored in plastic storage containers. Dirt on the surface of these products is usually no problem, which is why it is fine if they are stored in a container with no lid.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Pallet </strong><strong><strong>cages </strong></strong>are the second most commonly used stackable, large, bulk storage containers in industry. They are designed like plastic storage containers, in that their dimensions fit that of a pallet. They are around twice as high as plastic storage container. They are made out of four long, vertical and continuous steel angles, to which coarsely meshed grates (the side walls) are attached. The floor of a pallet cage is made out of wooden slats. Just like plastic storage containers, they have a wider angle welded onto the upper side of each foot. This means that they can be stacked onto a forklift or crane, just like the plastic storage containers. One side of the cages can fold down to ease the process of removing goods from the cage. Pallet cages are usually used for light and bulky items. The side panels are usually closed off with a cardboard or wood panel to order to ensure that these goods can be transported and stored safely. Pallet cages are suited for carrying large, bulky bags. They provide sufficient lateral support can reliably hold the required material.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_7342\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7342 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/shipping_container_2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"big used container for transport worldwide\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Container for shipping worldwide</figcaption></figure> <p>Looking for used plastic containers for sale could be difficult but pallet cages and <strong>plastic storage containers for sale</strong> are generally very easy to repair. As long as the feet aren't broken or too badly bent, damages can be repaired with a professional agent. It is completely possible to weld the side walls, or grates, of plastic storage containers and pallet cages. They usually weigh around 100kg on their own and so they can either be moved manually or by using a pallet truck.</p> <h2>Buying Used Steel Storage Containers at Second Hand Market</h2> <p>With the help of our website TradeMachines.com, you have the liberty to choose from a number of <strong>used steel containers for sale</strong> auctioned by our well-qualified partner auction houses, based on your specific needs and on the concept of industrial auctions.

These vehicles can be differentiated between <strong>indoor and outdoor-use</strong> <strong>vehicles</strong>. Vehicles for indoor use are generally not suited to drive on roads. They drive very slowly and are specially designed for the specific tasks that they will undertake. This includes industrial trucks, transport vehicles and machines for moving earth, including diggers, wheel loaders and tractors.</p>\r\n<p>Vehicles used outdoors are for transporting people and goods. There are numerous cars designed to transport people - called <strong>passenger vehicles</strong> - ranging from small two-seaters to representative, executive limousines. The cars that are mostly commercially used are representative vehicles. These are generally mid-sized cars with diesel engines, which have a lot of storage space and enough seats. <strong>Transportation vehicles</strong> are also very popular. Everything ranging from small <a href=\"//trademachines.com/pick-ups\"><strong>pick-up trucks</strong></a> to<strong>large lorries</strong> are used, depending on the size and amount of the goods, and how far they have to be transported. Standard-sized box trucks have established themselves next to the numerous other <strong>types of vehicles</strong>. Since TradeMachines is marketplace for collection of wide range of vehicle auctions, including 4x4 vehicles or <a href=\"//trademachines.com/military-surplus-vehicles\"><strong>military vehicles for sale</strong></a>, with vehicle price, specs and more information related to vehicle being provided, buying a Good-In-Condition vehicle while saving money by selecting smart deals by comparing online <strong>vehicle auctions</strong> from various auctioneers is made easy.</p>\r\n<h3>Buying used vehicles for indoor operations</h3>\r\n<p>Vehicles used indoors usually have specific tasks. They are <strong>constructed differently than the common automobiles and lorries found on roads</strong>. These vehicles are much more robust and have a longer working life. They are usually manufactured in relatively small batches in comparison to automobiles and lorries. Thereby, their reparation costs are much higher. Damage that occurs outside the regular wear and tear can lead to completely damaging a used forklift, digger or wheel loader. Instead of an odometer, these vehicles usually have an operating hours meter. Before entering into the <strong>used vehicles sale</strong> process, it is recommended to test all its functions especially when you are going for vehicle auctions. There are information portals available that can tell a buyer what kind of damages should be expected after a certain number of hours of operation. If the maintenance documentation has been taken care of, then this is a very useful tool to determine whether a used vehicle will still function. If this document is not available, then there should be a strong reduction in the price.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to valid certification and the ability to operate for sufficiently long periods of time, <strong>some checks</strong> can give preliminary indication as to what the condition of the car is. When first looking at <strong>used vehicles for sale</strong>, it is important to note the <strong>general condition</strong>. Numerous dents and rusty components are not necessarily a reason to not buy it, but one should definitely negotiate on the price. The windows, particularly the windscreen, should have no scratches or cracks. If the vehicle does not originate from a European mass manufacturer, then it will be very expensive to replace components.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, it is important to look at the <strong>front wheels</strong>. It is possible to examine their profile when turned completely to the left or right. If it is worn down on one side or on the inside, then the track is no longer safe. To fix this could cost alone about a hundred euros. Additionally, the adjustment needs to be examined. If the rod ends or shock absorbers are damaged, then it could lead to another several hundred euros.</p>\r\n<p>A heavily oiled <strong>engine</strong> only means one thing: hands off. A completely clean engine means: careful, freshly cleaned! It is possible that something could be covered up. With a cold engine, open the brake fluid reservoir and start the engine, with the clutch disengaged. If there is a loud knocking noise, then the engine is ruined. Usually it is not worth it for the buyer to repair this. If gas bubbles up in the brake fluid reservoir, then the <strong>cylinder head gasket</strong> is broken. This does not necessarily write off the vehicle, but it would significantly reduce the selling price. It can be a thousand euros or more, and it could be triple that with a with a BMW or other specific type of vehicle. A defective motor can also be identified if the coolant is oily or there is a constant blue or white smoke emitting from the exhaust. There are numerous tips available on the internet for how one could undertake a thorough inspection of a used car.</p>\r\n<h3>Small and mid-sized vehicles for sale</h3>\r\n<p>Small vehicles are used in operation for short distances. This means that they are often started with a cold engine, the gears are often switched and that the brakes are used a lot. Therefore, this means that the brakes, clutch and engine are often worn down. Additionally, if they are often driven through the city they also have a risk of having a damaged body. Buying and repairing vehicles among this <strong>list of vehicles</strong> is relatively affordable. They do not cost a lot if bought new. When buying a used vehicle, it is generally recommended to check for the right certification and the general condition of the car. <a href=\"//trademachines.com/passenger-cars\"><strong>Small cars</strong></a> can be bought on the used market for <strong>only several hundred dollars</strong>. If sold as service vehicles, they usually have a complete service history and are sold in accordance with their depreciation. <strong>Vehicles for sale cheap</strong> can be found, even within the range of intensively used vehicles, with a bit of expertise and close inspection of the critical points.</p>\r\n<h3>Representative vehicles</h3>\r\n<p>Contrary to the stop-and-go type of small vehicles, representative vehicles are used to travel longer distances. They can be run for a long time without any problems, even when often driving at full throttle. A tell tale sign that this has been a case is through <strong>small stone chippings at the front of the vehicle</strong>. If the paint at the front of a representative vehicle has small chips, then the vehicle has been travelling at high speeds. This can also lead to the engine, brakes, transmission and underbody being worn. However, if such a vehicle passes the normal check up and has good certification, then they are particularly favourable. They are commonly still usable as an introductory vehicle, even if their mileage is over 200,000km.</p>\r\n<h2>Executive Limousines</h2>\r\n<p>There are many special deals that can be made with high-end cars. These<strong> <a href=\"//trademachines.com/cars\">top used quality cars</a></strong> are generally excellently taken care of and have hardly been used. However, they can <strong>quickly lose their value</strong>, particularly when new models come onto the market. For this reason, particularly high-end vehicles in this range will be available for the price of a new small vehicle in just a few years.</p>\r\n<h3>Vans, Box Trucks and Lorries</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Vehicle <a href=\"//trademachines.com/delivery-vans\">vans</a></strong>, box trucks and station wagons are used very intensively: heavy loads; high speeds; switching between city and country driving; different drivers; bad maintenance. These characteristics all impact the condition of the vehicle. Additionally, they are usually not designed to last. For example, an effective rust protection is often not available on these vehicles. <strong>Before buying one of these vehicles second-hand, it is very important to do a thorough check</strong>. This is particularly the case for heavy-duty lorries. These are set up to be extremely durable and can be used for a decade, if well maintained. The maintenance of lorries is very expensive. Before buying a used lorry, it is important to ensure that a complete service history available, or that a thorough inspection has been done very recently.</p>\r\n<h3>Dumper Trucks for Sale in your region</h3>\r\n<p>Here you can find dumper trucks close to your location</p>\r\n<table class=\" aligncenter\" style=\"width: 100%;height: 140px;margin-top: 5px\" cellspacing=\"10\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><a href=\"//trademachines.com/dumper-trucks/in/florida\">Florida<br /></a><a href=\"//trademachines.com/dumper-trucks/in/massachusetts\">Massachusetts<br /></a><a href=\"//trademachines.com/dumper-trucks/in/nebraska\">Nebraska<br /></a></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><a href=\"//trademachines.com/dumper-trucks/in/new-york\">New York<br /></a><a href=\"//trademachines.com/dumper-trucks/in/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania<br /></a><a href=\"//trademachines.com/dumper-trucks/in/west-virginia\">West Virginia<br /></a></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n"},{"id":"1524_en","content":"<p>  The copier / printer is a device that is used to make copies of other documents, or originals only otherwise available in a digital format, both quickly and inexpensively. They can be used as standalone machines or in conjunction with one or more computers.</p> <h2>  Copier / Printer Machines and the Most Popular Manufacturers</h2> <p>  The xerographic printing that is used in most office photocopiers was introduced by the XEROX company in 1959 and heralded the end of labour intensive and expensive document copy making. Today most homes have at least one copier / printer, and even though the era of the paperless office has been predicted for some time, it doesn't seem as though it will happen any time soon, so all offices have some form of device for making paper copies of documents. The two most prevalent printing techniques might loosely be described as wet and dry. The inkjet method sprays minuscule droplets onto the paper, whereas laser printing is performed using powdered ink that is melted onto the paper. CANON offers what is generally regarded as the most popular range of imaging, print and document solutions in the world, and the company's output is strongly supported by those seeking to buy used copier / printer products. The name of XEROX has become virtually synonymous with document copying and the company offer a superb range of high-speed, print-on-demand production printers and copiers boasting a great advantage for the office by way of their advanced capabilities for high-volume digital production printing. All KODAK printers have WiFi connectivity and very low replacement ink cartridge costs, making them ideal for the home. The KYOCERA Ecosys P2035dn A4 mono laser printer has an enviable reputation for clarity and reliability. In the field of compact copier / printers the PANASONIC KX-MB1500 is noted for its user friendly controls and high speed, quality and resolution capabilities. The HEWLETT PACKARD HP Officejet Pro X451dw printer is an extremely fast copier / printer that is ideal for small to medium sized businesses.</p> <h2>  The Advantages of Buying a Used Copier / Printer</h2> <p>  Copier / printer equipment tends to depreciate at a startling rate. The average laser printer loses 70% of its value in the first year. Bearing this in mind it's not a surprise to discover that many companies and home users are looking to buy a used copier / printer. Buying used copier / printers means you can save a great deal of money, reducing your initial outlay and allowing you a tax advantage as your taxable assets will be less. Office equipment costs are on the rise, so why not check out what is available at used copier / printer auctions to see the large selection of pre-owned machines that is on offer? Used copier / printers can be refurbished for a fraction of the cost of buying new, and you can find yourself the pleased owner of an item that has many years of use left to offer.</p> <h2>  Copier / Printer Manufacturers</h2> <p>  The most popular manufacturers of copier / printers are CANON, DELL, EPSON, HEWLETT PACKARD, KODAK, KYOCERA, LEXMARK, OLIVETTI, PANASONIC, SAMSUNG, TOSHIBA and XEROX.

Therefore, the floor is not necessary, and not having it reduces the cost of the pallet shelf. A side effect is that these loads need to be stored in the exact right position. This means that loading a <strong>pallet rack is very safe</strong> and it optimally uses all the available place. They are particularly suited for automatic loading.</p>\r\n<h2>The structure of a pallet rack</h2>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt></dt>\r\n<dd>\r\n<p>Pallet racks are only made out of a few components. The stand on very stable feet, and are usually anchored to the floor or wall with steel dowels. The length of a system corresponds to its height. Some systems can be expanded. The feet are connected underneath by straight and diagonal connectors. The diagonal ones give the pallet rack the necessary stability at its base. The individual shelves are made out of powerful crossbeams. These are attached to the feet with a simple push-fit system. There is also the option of attaching the cross beams and feet via screws, brackets or other components. This achieves the highest level of security. Further diagonal supports are used to give the shelf stability along its longitudinal axis. If they are correctly installed, a heavy duty pallet racking <strong>can provide a solid and reliable service for over a decade. </strong></p>\r\n</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<p>Pallet rack systems are rarely coated. The most important crossbeams are usually only galvanised. This reduces the costs and means that potential damages are much more visible.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of industrial pallet racks</h2>\r\n<p>The standard pallet rack system is the simplest construction. They are most suited for small to mid-sized storage in normal, manual facilities. Assembly, recycling and the storing of raw materials, auxiliary materials and operating supplies can increase the efficiency and safety of a normal production facility.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Automatic high bay storage solutions</strong></h3>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_7559\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7559 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/pr-2-300x148.jpg\" alt=\"automatic pallet rack\" width=\"300\" height=\"148\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Automatic transport of pallets by independently operating loading systems</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>Dispatching facilities and companies with high productivity rates can increase their in-house logistics by using high bay storage units. The loading and unloading processes are sped up through use of <strong>automatic systems that ensure that the loading is always absolutely correct.</strong> In addition to self-driven units of independently operating loading systems, automatic high bay storage units also require a sophisticated sensor system for the shelves and the pallets. Nowadays, the RFID-Chips are used, which are a contact-free, optical and independent system. These use radio waves and do not require any light barriers or laser scanners. Optimal space utilisation is always achieved by using an intelligent, automatic pallet rack.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Mobile pallet rack</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Mobile pallet racks are used, when a lot of material need to be stored in a minimal amount of space. The entire shelf units can be moved, which reduces the space required for tunnels or passages to a minimum. Mobile pallet racks always move apart directly where they are approached. Intelligent electric systems and powerful engines mean that<strong> mobile pallet racks are highly automated.</strong> The safety aspects of this type of shelving unit should taken into consideration. The unauthorised and unsupervised entering of storage warehouses needs to be prevented. When buying an used pallet racking, it is important to make sure that there are enough emergency stop buttons available.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Channel storage systems </strong></h3>\r\n<p>Channel storage systems have a single integrated loading and unloading system. They have extremely large storage capacities for all important applications. Cold storage facilities are a common area of application for channel storage systems. A channel storage system is the<strong> ideal solution for in-house logistics in terms of efficiently cooling a workspace, </strong>which would otherwise be very expensive. Just like all other automatic pallet racks, the loading and unloading of a channel storage system happens independently.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Pallet flow racking systems</strong></h3>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_7564\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7564 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/pr-3-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"Pallet flow racking \" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pallet flow racking systems use depth to increase capacity</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>A <strong>pallet flow racking system</strong> uses the First in-First out principle. It is particularly suited for storing perishable products. A pallet flow racking system effectively prevents products in the last rows from being forgotten, where they would eventually expire. It is mostly used for storing foodstuffs, pharmaceutical products and important mechanical components like spare parts for aeroplanes. Modern pallet flow racking systems work without a separate electric engine, and therefore they do not require so much maintenance and are energy efficient.</p>\r\n<h2>Maintaining and rearing a pallet rack</h2>\r\n<p>Even though pallet storage racks are very robust, they can always be <strong>worn down to a certain extent. </strong>Therefore, regularly<strong> monitoring </strong>a pallet rack is very <strong>useful. </strong>It is important that the rotational accuracy of automatic high bay storage solutions is checked by an independent monitoring organisation, in order to ensure operational security. Tasks like tightening screws, can be undertaken in-house. The most suited tool for this is a torque wrench. A high rack <strong>forklift </strong>with an operator's seat is the ideal machine for safely reaching the screws. This is even more important when getting an used pallet rack as the security features should be totally checked up.</p>\r\n<h2>Pallet rack accessories</h2>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt></dt>\r\n<dd>Forklifts are accessories for pallet racks.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_7567\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7567 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/pr-4a-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"forklift in warehouse\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The perfect machines for handling pallet racks: Forklifts</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p><strong>The use of accessories can significantly increase the efficiency of an industrial pallet racking</strong>. For example, shelves that can be pulled out to ease the loading, unloading and storing of bulky goods. Grates are a cheap way to ensure that materials don't fall down if the shelves are badly loaded. Impact protection against damage is particularly useful in facilities that have a lot of forklift activity. The feet of a storage unit for heavy-duty components is particularly vulnerable. Knocks, bumps or tears can easily impact the whole construction, and in the worst cases, lead to the shelf system collapsing. Impact protection around the shelving's floor bolts can effectively prevent this from happening. Push-through guards prevent a product from accidentally being pushed out off the shelf. If, for example, one accidentally tries to store a pallet on a shelf that is already occupied by other pallets, a push-through guard will prevent these other goods from falling off the shelf. Rear wall covers are used to make it look as if the pallet rack system has a wall. This can be set up behind the pallet racking system, making it look like there is an entirely different workspace. The rear wall also protects the shelves from noise and dirt. To acquire an used pallet rack could be a very good alternative.</p>\r\n<p>One of the <strong>most important accessories </strong>for a conventional pallet rack is a <a href=\"//trademachines.com/forklifts\"><strong>forklift</strong></a>. Only <a href=\"//trademachines.com/electric-forklift\"><strong>electric</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/lpg-forklift\"><strong>gas forklifts</strong></a><strong> </strong>be used in indoor facilities so a good equipment is essential. <strong>Diesel-powered forklifts </strong>can also be used in outdoor facilities. Very high shelving units require a special high rack forklift, which has a particularly high lifting mast. Practice is very important in order to be able to operate these machines reliably and safely even so used pallet racks can be used for it.</p>\r\n<h2>Pallet racking manufacturers</h2>\r\n<p>A particularly wide range of different types of second hand pallet racking for sale are available from the companies SSI SCHÄFER, JUNGHEINRICH and SPLATTENHUBER. Cheap and simple pallet racks are available from the manufacturers META MULTIPAL, BRÜCKLAGERTECHNIK and ESTANT GMBH.<br />Recommended companies for forklifts or used pallet racking for sale include LINDE, <strong style=\"background-color: initial\"><a href=\"//trademachines.com/manufacturer/clark\">CLARK</a></strong>, JUNGHEINRICH, TOYOTA and RUDOLF MAXEIN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13593 size-full\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/pallet-racking-systems.jpg\" alt=\"pallet racking systems\" width=\"1090\" height=\"576\" /></p>"},{"id":"1523_en","content":"<h2><strong>Used Office Equipment</strong></h2> <p> Owners and employees have stated that in addition to functionality, office equipment has representative and motivational purposes. A new office desk can be seen as a sign of appreciation. An owner or manager of a facility cannot host guests over the decades with the same office furniture. Just like every other product used by a business, office furniture can also depreciate. Therefore, the regular renewal of used furniture is useful, even if just for tax reasons. Another reason to replace office furniture is for atmosphere, hygiene and technical possibilities. Which means that there is a really comprehensivly big market for used office equipment. Start-ups, founders, people who work from home and freelancers are all thankful recipients of the high-quality, but cheap office furniture available. The used market is so comprehensive, that even those who have high requirements for their office furniture could find the right products on the used market. An used office furniture depot is an example of where is possible to find the office essentials. It is highly recommended, that all components that are bought, fit to each other aesthetically. A mix of very different tables, chairs and cupboards can easily leave a bad impression on one's customers, and can be demotivating for the employees. This is not necessary, because there is a wide-range of second hand office furniture available in office equipment auctions. As many offices change the furniture is an opportunity for another ones to change their own by acquiring used office equipment.</p> <h2> <strong>Tables and containers</strong></h2> <p> The workspace in an office is the desk. However, a table is not just a table. Nowadays, the simplest models only consist of a base, four feet and a worktop. There are numerous designs and functions available: sloping or tipping panels; height-adjustable feet; large tables with round corners; space-saving corner desks; desks with integrated containers; modular expanded or combined tables. The only difference between buying a used office furniture or new desks is that <strong><strong>used office furniture tables only cost a fraction of the price of new office desk tables. </strong></strong></p> <p> Containers are depositories for important goods, which need to be located directly at the desk. In addition to paper and pens, this also includes important documents, hard drives, cables and more. They are known for their versatility, robustness, flexibility and high capacity. Normally, containers can be locked. Therefore, when buying used office equipment, it is always important to make sure that the key is available and lock is in a working condition. It can be tricky to find used office furniture containers that do not have damaged drawers. It is highly recommended to remove the file drawers from filing cabinets, when buying a used container, also so that the containers can be thoroughly cleaned. Every manufacturer has their own system for fixing cabinet drawers. Just looking online for used office equipment fixes guide can be very helpful. The manufacturers usually have comprehensive documents available, or a very helpful customer service helpline and a wide range of office furniture for sale.</p> <p>Business furniture is very versatile and easy to find online. Computer desks are changed each time for several reasons and sold in used office furniture auctions, that gives a choice for many enterprises which don't want to spend a high amount in something basic as an office desk.</p> <h2> <strong>Conference and office chairs</strong></h2> <p> Buying used chairs is just a matter of taste and there are differing opinions of whether one would like to use a second hand chair or not. It is definitely recommended, to buy a high-quality, used executive desks and chairs over a cheap and new chair. Long-term stability, adjustable seating and comfort can only be guaranteed when buying real brands. <strong style=\"font-weight: bold\">Cheap office chairs </strong>are always a compromise on comfort and security<strong style=\"font-weight: bold\">. </strong>Professional upholsterers and saddlers can cheaply refurbish a high-quality but worn-out office chair. They will also deal with hygienic concerns. Conference and office chairs are hardly used; their use is usually restricted to several hours a month. A complete set of chairs with a matching table makes a great impression on customers and investors for e.g. start-ups. There are a lot of good quality products available on the second-hand market finding therefore many office furniture for sale.</p> <p> It is also possible to get cheap used office equipment from used office furniture solutions where products like wood benches, sofas, office cubicles, paper shredders, shelving systems,conference tables, metal and wooden cabinets, seating and many other office supplies parts. If these are covered with artificial leather, then they are easy to clean and can be made to look almost new. <strong><strong>Therefore, these pieces of furniture can be bought for a tenth of the original price</strong></strong>.</p> <h2> <strong>Cupboards, chests and shelves for the office</strong></h2> <p> The office equipment that has the least amount of wear and tear are the office furniture storage units. Even if used often, office furniture units are usually not many visible damages on an used office furniture equipment like cupboard, open storage racks, filing cabinet, file drawers, etc. Modern cupboards used in offices are easy to disassemble and are particularly easy to transport, for that reason to buy used office equipment is very common. Usually it is difficult to mount cupboards and therefore it is advisable to hire a professional moving company for transporting the cupboards, to ensure that they are not damaged. </p> <h2> <strong>Kitchens</strong></h2> <p> A well-set up office also needs a kitchen. As a small oasis for the employees, a coffee machine or cooking facilities is important for providing life's necessities. In addition to the standard kitchen set up, there is also a good choice of ultra-compact office kitchens available. These are particularly useful for offices without much space. The kitchen is a unit that is easily contaminated, and so their price does decline. However, with enough effort, uncontaminated kitchens can be refurbished. A nice atmosphere and hygienic cooking area can also be created with<strong style=\"font-weight: bold\"> used office equipment for kitchen </strong>found on industrial auctions.</p> <h2> <strong>Electronics</strong></h2> <p> In addition to used office furniture, used office electronics like printers can also be bought on the used market and on the industrial auctions. However, most of these devices are not very expensive when bought new. Telephones, PCs, office computer monitors and printers can still be too expensive for start-up newly found organisations or freelancers. Office devices are generally replaced long before they actually reach their expiry date, because they can no longer fulfil the office's requirements. It is recommended to <strong>thoroughly test the used office equipment </strong>like&nbsp;electric devices, chairs, tables, etc, of all kinds before buying them. If they pass these tests, there is nothing against buying a used&nbsp;printer or&nbsp;photocopier,&nbsp;telephone, monitor for the office. Because these are available particularly cheaply, it is not so bad if they do not last long. The second-hand office equipment market has so many of these devices available, that anything will be very easy to replace.</p> <h2> <strong>Suppliers of office equipment</strong></h2> <p> Representative, aesthetically pleasing office equipment, which is durable and robust, are available from the companies PALMBERG, FM-MÖBEL and FEBRÜ.

With exception of the input and output areas, these machines are completely covered. The input point is where the shelves are loaded.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_10374\" style=\"width: 285px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10374\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/vertical-storage-carousel.jpg\" alt=\"storage system with mobile shelves\" width=\"285\" height=\"157\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mobile shelves store equipment vertically</figcaption></figure> <h2>How does a carousel work</h2> <p>Vertical carousels have an electronic control system. The terminal delivers the desired product either from an inputted <strong>bar code</strong>, a search system or an article number. Then the shelves move, fully automatically, up until the shelf containing the required product reaches the operator. The product can then be taken easily.</p> <h2>The characteristics of a carousel</h2> <p>The main advantage of a carousel is how quickly it can deliver the required product to the operator. Carousels eliminate the need to laboriously look through static shelving units. The delivery of goods is additionally sped up through use of a distance-time system. This determines the shortest distance between the product and the operator. With particularly large carousels, this can significantly reduce the time required.</p> <p>Carousels are machines for <strong>saving </strong><strong>space. </strong><strong>They can be very efficiently </strong>loaded. Unlike static shelves, carousels eliminate empty space. Carousels are very <strong>ergonomic. </strong>All products can be stored and taken from a very comfortable height. Bending over and stretching to reach for products is no longer necessary. Stairs and ladders are also no longer required. Carousels can be programmed with the “First in-first out (FIFO) accumulator”. First in-First out is particularly important for all perishable products. Carousels provide a good quality assurance for the food and pharmaceutical industries.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_10392\" style=\"width: 287px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-10392\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/vertical-carousels-for-wheels.jpg\" alt=\"vertical carousel storage for wheels \" width=\"287\" height=\"121\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tires stored in a vertical carousel</figcaption></figure> <p>Carousels are completely enclosed and have additional safety features, which means that they are very safe to operate. Injuries from carousels can only happen intentionally or from highly negligent misuse. A limited access control system can be implemented to ensure that only authorised workers have access to certain shelves.</p> <p>Use of a carousel can significantly reduce the need for industrial trucks. The “goods to man” principle also eliminates the need for lift trucks.</p> <p>However, the “goods to man” principle can also be one of the disadvantages of carousels. <strong>Only one person </strong>can use the shelving system <strong>at a time.</strong> This can be a problem during peak times, when queues can cause interruptions to work flows. This problem can be solved by using several shelving units. However, this is a limited solution. Another disadvantage is that carousels have relatively <strong>high installation costs</strong> and require disciplined operators. They can easily be about 100 times more expensive than installing a regular shelving unit. However, these costs can also be calculated against the space saved by having this type of shelving unit.</p> <p>Loading a carousel for the first time is a very demanding process, because every product needs to fit into a defined storage space. The discipline during the continuous use of a carousel is the deciding factor of how efficient and durable the machine will be. If goods are continuously being removed without confirmationthen the carousel will quickly loose its efficiency. In most situations this problem can be avoided through use of an efficient goods management system. If all products are equipped with<strong>a </strong><strong><strong>RFI</strong></strong><strong>D-Chip, </strong>then the carousel can automatically log all changes to the goods stored. With all the right accessories, a carousel is a very valuable component for a <strong>modern </strong><strong><strong>goods ma</strong></strong><strong>nagement system. </strong></p> <figure id=\"attachment_10402\" style=\"width: 294px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-10402\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/vertical-carousel1.jpg\" alt=\"Store material place saving with a Vertical patanoster \" width=\"294\" height=\"162\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vertical patanoster in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <h2>Sizes and types of carousels</h2> <p>There are<strong> two types of carousels</strong>. Carousels that operate horizontally are called “<strong>carousel racks</strong>”, whereas carousels that operate vertically are often called “<strong>paternosters</strong>”. There is thus a wide range of designs available based on the two basic principles of the<strong> vertical paternosters</strong> and <strong>horizontal carousel storage units</strong>. The carrying capacity of a single shelf can be several hundred kilograms. Mid-sized, heavy and bulky goods can be just as well stored in vertical carousels as small and light goods. The industry has a range of different solutions. Nowadays, storage systems that can carry <strong>a thousand kilogrammes per shelf and 60 tonnes per system </strong>can be easily produced.</p> <h2>Working with a carousel</h2> <p>As was already mentioned, the disciplined logging of what products have been taken out and put into the carousel is the central deciding factor on how efficient the system will be in the longterm. There are several systems in place for informally loading a vertical carousel storage system. Depending on the complexity of the goods management system that is place, it is important to have special training when first loading the carousel.</p> <p>Vertical carousels often <strong>coll</strong><strong><strong>ect a</strong></strong><strong> lot of dust and dirt</strong>. It is very important to regularly clean the shelves and components for health and safety, and hygiene reasons. Assistants, service providers or contract workers can be hired for this job. All vertical carousels have a function, which allowed the shelves (with exception of those that are locked) to be manually controlled. Before cleaning the shelves, assistants need to be trained on how to place the goods back onto the shelves.</p> <p>The technical maintenance of a carousel vertical should only be undertaken by specially trained personnel. Reparation services should not be undertaken ad hoc, even if the machine breaks down, is defective or jams. The safety system of a vertical carousel is only suited for normal operations. If these safety systems are bypassed, then the carousel vertical could pose a significant risk to the life of workers.</p> <h2>Buying Used Vertical Carousels</h2> <p>There is currently<strong> a revolut</strong>ion happening in the field of<strong> vertical storage systems</strong>. Many companies are now replacing their long-used paternosters with lift systems. These are faster, more robust, simpler to maintain and more energy efficient than the old paternoster system. The main advantage of a lift system is that only <strong>one shelf moves at a time</strong>. When taking things in and out of a paternoster, the whole shelving system has to move. Most investment programmes include getting rid of these used vertical carousel storage systems. <strong>Paternosters</strong> are now out of date, which means they are available very cheaply on the used market. Most of these machines, which are from the 1980s, are no longer useful machines because they cannot be adjusted to fit modern management systems. However, they are still well suited to <strong>replace</strong> existing storage capacities.</p> <p></p> <h2>Suppliers of carousels</h2> <p>The most recommended suppliers of vertical carousels are HÄNEL, KARDEX, RAIMANN, TITAN and LOCKWEILER. Vertical carousels for heavy loads are available from MEGAMAT and SCHWAB. Special systems for drums and coils are available from the companies VDIR, GIOVANELLI and VIDMAR. The companies DEXION, EWS and ITB provide horizontal carousels. </p>"},{"id":"1526_en","content":"<p><strong>Industrial bearing and storage</strong> occupy a central position of importance in today's industrial world.

Modern shelving systems vary greatly in size, shape, materials and fitment.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">The Differences in Shelving Systems</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The differences between <strong>shelving systems</strong> are fundamental. Pantry shelving systems for the kitchen, which are simple wooden shelving systems intended to support the weight of food, are going to be completely incompatible with van shelving systems, which need to be riveted in to an often slanted metal structure, and regardless of what cross-constructed jobs have been conducted, the fact remains that finding the right mobile or <strong>wall shelving systems</strong> does not have a single definitive solution.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The availability and range of storage <strong>shelving systems</strong> stretches far and wide, and the uses of such structures can be just as varied. Industrial shelving systems will need to be stronger, larger and more durable than standard <strong>wood shelving systems</strong> found in the home. Any industrial supply company will be able to provide a system that can be readily installed straight off the shelf, or for a higher premium, a more bespoke and fully tailored approach can be had. In today's automated world, adjustable shelving systems are the norm in many business environments, and it doesn't just stop at basics such as roller racking. An adjustable shelving system can incorporate just about any small or large business need, with entire systems that can accommodate a workforce walking around inside it, or the availability to be stacked onto a truck 'as is' and replaced with an empty, identical counterpart.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">For smaller businesses who cannot afford a five or even six figure price tag, smaller commercial <strong>shelving systems</strong> are still an option. Companies such as Bruynzeel and Invicta, both market leaders in their field, can provide very competitively priced metal shelving systems to fit around budgets and more modest criteria, whilst still providing durability and ergonomic satisfaction.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">For the home user, many will be familiar with the modular shelving system model; a system that appears to be made of stacked boxes, and on many occasions is just that; however, this design is now available from just about any home furniture specialist; DIY stores have a wealth of <strong>modular shelving systems</strong> in their ranges, and for a surprisingly low price. In a home DIY setting, garage shelving systems, complete with fixing kits, can be purchased easily and without much relative expense. The difference between a small home shelving kit and more robust steel shelving systems is that they are intended to be riveted to a primarily stone surface, and will be more long lasting in what is inevitably going to be a damper and wetter environment than the average lounge or bedroom. If a fully fledged steel shelving system sounds like overkill, more modestly priced wire shelving systems can still rise to the task and withstand grim weather conditions whilst ensuring that your items stay where you want them to stay.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Who Manufactures S<strong>helving  Systems</strong>?</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">There are many different companies who provide <strong>shelving systems</strong>. As previously mentioned, BRUYNZEEL and INVICTA are market leaders in modern shelving, and for more standard fits, KIMER, SPERRIN, and APEX LINVAR provide full systems. There are also more specialised manufacturers; SHELFSPAN provide catering shelf units, CAEM concentrate on retail environments, BOYCO provide work based storage shelves and lockers, and ANCO can provide both the shelves and a full installation service. For home settings, DIY stores provide an incredibly wide range of small <strong>shelving systems</strong> and modular units.</p>"},{"id":"1522_en","content":""},{"id":"1551_en","content":"<h2>Used Loaders for Sale</h2>\r\n<p>Most often used in the construction industry, loaders are heavy equipment machines with front mounted buckets or scoops, used for moving loose materials over short distances. <strong>A variety of specialised types of loaders are available</strong>, including wheel, crawler, backhoe, swing and log loaders.</p>\r\n<h2>The Top Manufacturers Of Loaders</h2>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_6932\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6932\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/Volvo-loader-excavator-300x167-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"Volvo Loader/Excavator\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volvo excavator loading truck</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>Originally developed in the agricultural industry in the 1920s and 1930s, when buckets and scoops were added to tractors, front loaders have evolved over the decades into both general usage and highly task-specific variants. <strong>The loader assembly can be permanently mounted on the vehicle</strong> or it might be a removable attachment. Wheel loaders are the most commonly used and most versatile loaders. Crawler loaders combine the capabilities of the wheel loader with the stability and multi terrain functionality of tracks. Backhoe loaders offer the combination of loader and excavator attachments. Swing loaders have a rigid frame and a swinging boom capable of rotating through 180 degrees or more and are advantageous when space is limited. <strong>Log loaders</strong> are highly specialised timber industry adaptations of the basic loader. Popular makes and models include JCB, who offer a high performance range from 2 to 24 tonnes. The Cat 994F, from CATERPILLAR is proving a firm success.

Their excellent manoeuvrability includes the option of the machine turning in its own length. The diesel engine is generally placed in the<strong> rear of the machine</strong> to provide the driver with better forward visibility and to serve as an effective counterweight to a full bucket.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8655\" style=\"width: 286px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-8655\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/cl-2-300x153.jpg\" alt=\"crawler loader\" width=\"286\" height=\"146\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Track loader has versatility and can be used not only on a construction site</figcaption></figure> <p>Crawler loaders are predominantly used for scooping up loose material to place onto a truck or conveyor.

The <strong>JOHN DEERE 755D track loader</strong> is the largest of the company's three crawler loaders and has the benefit of their Total Machine Control system. The <strong>CATERPILLAR 973D crawler loader</strong> is also proving to be highly rated in the industry. When it comes to<strong> compact crawler loaders</strong>, JCB (who produced the first rear engine hydrostatic tracked loader in 1971), CATERPILLAR and BOBCAT are definitely leading the field in positive feedback. However, the TEREX PT-35 is rapidly gaining ground due to its power, intuitive controls and tight manoeuvrability.</p> <h2>The Advantages Of Buying Used Track Loader At Auction</h2> <p>Since their 1960s heyday the demand for large<strong> crawler loaders</strong> has declined due to the rise in popularity of the hydraulic excavator, which can perform the same tasks and more. Only JOHN DEERE, CATERPILLAR and LIEBHERR make the larger track loaders today. This has led to a thriving used track loader for sale market, where this piece of equipment can be picked up at a more affordable price than their brand new counterparts. <strong>Crawler loader auctions</strong> are a great way to view a wide selection of these durable and reliable machines and conveniently compare prices and condition.</p> <p></p> <h2>Track Loader Manufacturers</h2> <p>AGRISON, AHLMANN, ALLIS-CHALMERS, ARAMINE, ATLAS, AVANT, BELAZ, BELL, BOBCAT, BUHLER, BUCYRUS, CASE, CATERPILLAR, CHANGLIN, CHENGGONG, CLARK, COYOTE, CURUKOVA, DAEWOO, DEZZI, DOOSAN, DRESSER, EIMCO, ELPHINSTONE, EUCLID, EUROTRAC, FIAT, FORD, FOTON, FOXX, FURUKAWA, GEHL, GHH, GIANT, HALLA, HANOMAG, HITACHI, HOUGH, HYDREMA, HYTEC, HYUNDAI, IMECA, INGERSOLL-RAND, JCB, JCI, JOHN DEERE, JUNLIAN, KAWASAKI, KOBELCO, KOMATSU, KRAMER, KUBOTA, LETOURNEAU, LIEBHERR, LINK-BELT, LONKING, LOWTRAC, MAGNUM, MANITOU, MASSEY-FERGUSON, MICHIGAN, MITSUBISHI, MITSUI, MOROOKA, MULTIONI, MTI, MUSTANG, NELSON, NEW HOLLAND, OLIVER, PALAZZANI, O&amp;K, PAUS, PEL-JOB, QINGDAO, RHINO, SAMSUNG, SCHAEFF, SCHAFFER, SDLG, SEM, STRIEGEL, TAKEUCHI, TAMROCK, TCM, TEREX, THALER, TIMBERJACK, TITAN, TORO, TROJAN, VENIERI, VOLVO, VOSTOSUN, WABCO, WACKER NEUSON, WILLMAR, XCMG, XGMA, XIAJIN,YANMAR, YTO, ZEPPELIN, ZETTELMEYER.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13328\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/cat-953.jpg\" alt=\"cat 953 track loader\" width=\"1067\" height=\"672\" /></p>"},{"id":"1553_en","content":"<p><figure id=\"attachment_10170\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10170 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/telescopic-loader-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"TAIAN TL1500 Telescopic Loader\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Telescopic Loaders are very useful on rough terrain</figcaption></figure></p> <h2>Telescopic Loaders Manufacturers</h2> <p>A <strong>telescopic loader</strong> can provide a great deal of <strong>versatility</strong> in areas where <strong>space</strong> is <strong>restricted</strong> or the terrain is <strong>uneven.</strong> SCHAFFER telescopic loaders and <strong>JCB</strong> telehandlers are <strong>amongst</strong> the <strong>most distinguished</strong> in <strong>their class,</strong> and are particularly appreciated in the agricultural sector.

These legs can also be used to adjust the track width and the height of the vehicle over a wide range of dimensions, ensuring that the machines remain highly flexible and can be adapted to the surrounding conditions, both in drive mode and work mode, when the stabilizers on the legs are extended. This means that they are ideally suited for working in locations such as very steep slopes or streams. Walking dragline excavators are intended for excavating large volumes of soils. The specific ground pressure while working with a walking excavator is pretty small which permits the use of walking draglines on excavating soils with low bearing capacity.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Walking Excavators and its Parts</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The major elements which make up a walking dragline are: support base, rotating platform, superstructure, working equipment, electrical equipment and walking mechanism.

href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\">farm machinery</a></strong> the chopper can also be used with a <a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\"><strong>used tractor</strong></a> you already own. The corn cut by sharp knives goes to the chopper, a VMax chopping cylinder, which is driven from the engine's crankshaft by a powerband. Pre-compression is used to improve the quality of the chop. The chopped corn is then blown through a chute into a trailer which takes it to where it is needed for storage.</p> <h3>Used Corn Choppers at Second Hand Market</h3> <p>Corn these days is one of the most popular agriculture grows at farms across the world. That is whey Corn Choppers were invited, save you time. You can also save money with used corn choppers, buy it at used market or auctions. These machines were built to last and endure many work hours and heavy duty work. You can get a used corn chopper that is in excellent condition, just make sure you will check also dimensions and weight to make sure the transportation won't cost you as much. But these days most used corn choppers sellers already include the transportation fees, just make sure this is the case.</p> <h4>Corn Chopper By CLAAS</h4> <p>The Jaguar 980 corn chopper is self-propelled and has excellent cab visibility. Inside is a <strong>CEBIS system</strong> where machine settings can be controlled. Variable chop lengths are possible and front tyre pressures can be adjusted in order to gain more traction. There is also a cooling fan, a 1500l diesel tank and a silage additive tank. This is made by <strong>CLAAS</strong>, known for reliability. More adjustments are possible with this machine than with most others including the ability to vary chop lengths and to gain more traction in wet conditions by adjusting the pressure on the front tyres.</p> <h3>Chopping Corn Silage Manufacturers</h3> <div>Other significant manufacturers of corn choppers include KUHN, JOHN DEERE, NEW HOLLAND, TEAGLE, FIMAKS, AVANT TECHNO, POTTINGER, LELEY, J.F. STOLL and LUCAS. A cheaper trailed corn silage chopper for sale can be found to save waiting for a contractor. <p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15724 size-full\"

style=\"background-color: initial\">Plows </strong>used as <a href=\"//trademachines.com/agricultural\"><strong>farming machinery</strong></a> are mechanical today. Versus those pulled by animals in years past, ploughs are now pulled by tractors that can also be found here at TradeMachines in <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\">tractor auctions</a></strong>. Numerous manufacturers provide a range of plows as <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/soil-preparation-equipment\">soil preparation equipment</a></strong>, cutting, <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/fertilisingplant-protection-equipment\">fertilizers</a></strong>, and other farm work. JOHN DEERE is known for their range of models from three wheel tractors that pull equipment or those with the plough accessory on the front. KVERNELAND has the ES to LS models that work in various soil conditions at different horsepower including the ES at 150hp. OVERUM VARI FLEX CX is another <strong>plow for sale</strong> with a fully mounted reversible plough accessory.</p>\r\n<h3>The History of the Plough</h3>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_26387\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-26387\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/10/JOHN-DEERE-3710-moldboard-plow.jpg\" alt=\"JOHN DEERE 3710 moldboard plow\" width=\"400\" height=\"288\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">JOHN DEERE 3710 moldboard plow</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>The plough is thought to have been invented sometime around 6,000 BC in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, when man first began to harness the power of animals. The Egyptians and Romans made further modifications to the basic concept but it wasn't until the 17th century when major improvements were made. The last half century has seen some major leaps forward in plough technology, including hydraulic turnover systems, furrow width adjustment, technologically advanced frame designs, shear bolts and auto-reset systems; assets which need to be taken into consideration when looking for <strong>plows for sale</strong> and choosing the most suitable used plows for your requirements.</p>\r\n<h3>Types of Plough</h3>\r\n<p>The introduction of the <strong>mouldboard plow</strong> or frame plough was significant in that it cut down on the amount of time needed to prepare a field. The mouldboard section of the plough is instrumental in inverting the slice of topsoil cut by the ploughshare and laying it in the furrow at about a forty five degree angle. Reversible ploughs have two mouldboards mounted back to back, one right turning and the other left turning. While one is in use the other can be suspended, and the pair are turned over at the end of the row. 4 furrow ploughs are reversible ploughs capable of working a larger area of soil at one pass, thereby vastly increasing efficiency. It was the coming of mechanisation that made the use of multiple furrow ploughs such as the 4 furrow plough possible, as they require more power to drag through the soil. The <strong>chisel plow</strong> is used to attain deep tillage while causing relatively little soil disruption. This implement, unlike a moldboard plow, does not turn or invert the soil, thereby helping to prevent soil erosion and allowing a layer of organic matter and crop residue to remain on the surface. This has led to the chisel plow being regarded as a boon to sustainable agriculture practices. The <strong>disc plow</strong> has a number of individually mounted concave discs arranged into two or four sections. These are slightly offset to maximise their effectiveness, so that they loosen and pick up the soil that is cut. This implement is particularly useful in hard and dry soils or in scrubby or rocky land, and are sometimes known as <strong>harrow ploughs</strong>. If you are looking for a tractor plough the most crucial implement to consider is a disc plough, as initial cultivation can be extremely difficult without the proper equipment.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Used Plows For Sale</h2>\r\n<p>The major benefit of buying <strong>used plows</strong> is the greatly reduced cost. Farm equipment is designed to be reliable, durable and long lasting, so you know that the used <strong>tractor plough for sale</strong> that you have your eye on at a second hand agricultural equipment markt is likely to give you many years of useful service. A used plow may be just a few years old, as large farms regularly update their equipment, so you can end up with an item that is almost as <strong>good as new</strong> at a <strong>fraction of the cost</strong> of actually buying new.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_7340\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7340\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/10/plow-at-field-300x166-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"Plow working on a field\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plough preparing soil</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>Advantages of buying <strong>used plows on the second hand market</strong> include picking up farming equipment at below market value. You can find low cost plows for sale that are still usable and highly durable. Auction sites and other second hand sellers always check the <strong>ploughs for sale</strong> before they are sold to ensure all are in working order. With depreciation costs already out of the way, you may be able to upgrade the engine or plow parts for your plough while keeping within budget at auction locations.</p>\r\n<h3>Major Manufacturers of Plows</h3>\r\n<p>Buying <strong>plow trucks </strong>is possible from several major manufacturers since they build to last. These manufacturers include JOHN DEERE, OVERUM, KUHN, KVERNELAND, GEHL, INTERNATIONAL, KIRBY, OSWALT, BJM, JAYLOR, JIFFY, and APACHE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13183\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/10/kverneland-plough.jpg\" alt=\"kverneland plough\" width=\"1459\" height=\"879\" /></p></p>\r\n"},{"id":"1584_en","content":"<p><strong style=\"background-color: initial\">ELECTRONICS<br /> INDUSTRY</strong></p> <p><strong>ELECTRONICS<br /> INDUSTRY- AN OVERVIEW</strong></p> <p>Electronics industry is the business of creating, designing,<br /> producing, and selling devices such as radios, televisions, stereos,<br /> computers, semiconductors, transistors, and integrated circuits. The<br /> electronics industry transformed factories, offices, and homes,<br /> emerging as a key economic sector that rivalled the chemical, steel,<br /> and automobile industries in size. Important sectors that have made<br /> great advances include laser and optical electronics, digital<br /> electronics, and microwave electronics. Advances in the field of<br /> electronics have also played a key role in the development of space<br /> technology and satellite communications; inaugurated a revolution in<br /> the computer industry that led to the introduction of the personal<br /> computer; resulted in the introduction of computer-guided robots in<br /> factories; produced systems for storing and transmitting data<br /> electronically; greatly expanded the market for popular music and<br /> culture; and, in the process, transformed life at home, the office,<br /> and the factory. Many of these innovations, such as the transistor,<br /> had their origins in military research, which needed increasingly<br /> complex electronic devices for modern high-tech warfare. The<br /> electronics scope also encompasses embedded electronics in transport<br /> (cars, planes, trains, etc.), in defence equipment, in IT<br /> infrastructures as well as electronics used in manufacturing process<br /> or professional services in order to boost productivity.</p> <p><strong>ORIGIN<br /> OF ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY</strong></p> <p>The industry traces its origins to the invention of the two-element<br /> electron tube (1904) by John Ambrose Flemming, and the three-element<br /> tube (1906) by Lee De Forest. These inventions led to the development<br /> of commercial radio in the 1920s. In 1947, the electronics industry<br /> made another important advance when John Bardeen, Walter Brattain,<br /> and William Shockley invented the transistor. Smaller, lighter, and<br /> more durable than the vacuum tubes that had been used in radios,<br /> transistors touched off a period of progressive miniaturization of<br /> electronic devices. Integrated circuits, which were developed in the<br /> 1950s, allowed the integration of several circuits into one circuit,<br /> and the introduction of analog devices in the 1960s vastly increased<br /> the amount of information that could be stored on a single silicon<br /> chip.</p> <p>In the 1960s, the U.S. consumer electronics industry went into<br /> decline as manufacturers were unable to compete with the quality and<br /> pricing of foreign products, especially the electronic goods produced<br /> by Japanese companies such as Sony and Hitachi. By the 1980s,<br /> however, U.S. manufacturers became the world leaders in semiconductor<br /> development and assembly. In the 1990s semiconductors were essential<br /> components of personal computers and most other electronic items<br /> (including cellular telephones, televisions, medical equipment, and<br /> \"smart\" appliances). While U.S. companies are still a major<br /> presence in the semiconductor industry (representing about 40% of<br /> world sales in 1998), the consumer items themselves are mostly made<br /> overseas. Worldwide electronic sales were nearly $700 billion in<br /> 1997. As new societal markets with tremendous market potential will<br /> develop, electronics contribution to the global wealth creation will<br /> grow further. It is therefore a strategic industry, which should<br /> benefit from at least part of the massive recovery plans put in place<br /> in 2009 by major economies worldwide.</p> <p><strong>ELECTRONICS<br /> INDUSTRY VALUE CHAIN </strong></p> <p>The electronics industry represented 1140 billion Euros in 2008 and<br /> is today comparable in size to other important industrial branches<br /> such as the Car industry (1800 billion Euros in 2008). A rather<br /> impressive figure for such a recent industry whose origins go back<br /> only half a century Growth cycles and electronics pervasion are the<br /> roots of such a rapid development. First driven by government<br /> applications in the 60s and 70s, enterprises in the 80s and finally<br /> individuals since the 90s, the electronics industry is re-inventing<br /> itself since its origin thanks to massive R&amp;D investment, which<br /> translates into permanent new product introduction. Today, new<br /> societal needs in energy, security or health are relying on<br /> electronic solutions that are still to be developed, providing<br /> long-term growth perspectives for the overall industry for the next<br /> decades. Although the electronics industry demonstrates more mature<br /> growth profiles, it is still a young industry with major growth<br /> perspectives ahead.</p> <p><strong>PRODUCTS<br /> FROM ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY</strong></p> <p><strong>CAPITAL GOODS</strong></p> <p>Capital goods include such products as electric motors, electronic<br /> control equipment, switchgear, and power supply lines. It is<br /> primarily a capital goods that manufactures goods which are used by<br /> other companies for their production.</p> <p><strong>INTERMEDIATE<br /> GOODS</strong></p> <p>Electronic<br /> components, which include semiconductors, count as intermediate<br /> goods. Intermediate goods are also used in the manufacture of goods.<br /> However, in contrast to capital goods, they are integrated into these<br /> goods. The demand for these two categories of goods comes from<br /> industrial companies. The general economic environment determines the<br /> level of activity in the electronic industry: in an upswing phase<br /> firms produce more and have above-average demand for intermediate<br /> goods and capital goods.</p> <p><strong>CONSUMER<br /> GOODS</strong></p> <p>The<br /> third category of goods is consumer goods. Here, the product spectrum<br /> includes such goods as televisions, washing machines and light<br /> fittings and electric lamps. Key factors for these goods are above<br /> all private consumption and demographics. As the population declines,<br /> the potential for consumption declines.</p> <p><strong>APPLICATIONS</strong><strong>OF</strong><strong>ELECTRONIC<br /> INDUSTRY</strong></p> <p>The<br /> core areas of Industrial Electronics can be segmented into Power<br /> Electronics, Factory Automation, Mechatronics, Intelligent Systems<br /> and emerging technologies that include the Internet based<br /> applications. Some of the key drivers of Industrial Electronics today<br /> are the trend towards more compact components and system integration,<br /> innovative products offering greater flexibility, safety,<br /> reliability, energy savings, wide range of connectivity,<br /> self-diagnostic facilities and products with long operating<br /> lifetimes.

One of the two rollers is powered, and the other roller creates the tension needed to prevent the grinding belt from slipping. The belt can be replaced, if all tension is released. Belt grinders with a particularly narrow grinding belt are called a <strong><strong>band file. </strong></strong>Hand-held belt grinding machines are equipped with a handle and a knob, in order to ensure a two-handed operation. They are either available with a power cable, or are battery-operated. All established manufacturers of power tools have a range of belt grinders in their product range.</p> <p>Stationary belt grinders guide the workpiece over the grinding point. This can be very advantageous, depending on the design and type of work. This method can process small and light workpieces more precisely, than if they were clamped in and processed using a hand-held belt grinder. They are made out of a table with an attached belt grinder. Alternatively, the <strong><strong>table grinder </strong></strong>is tightly screwed onto the work top.</p> <p>Particularly large types of belt grinders are the so-called <strong><strong>long belt grinders.</strong></strong> These are used to process workpieces with large surfaces. <strong><strong>Grinding machines </strong></strong>are used for de-rusting<strong><strong>, deburring and preparing</strong></strong><strong><strong>heavy metal components</strong></strong> so that they can be further processed. These stationary machines are only used in specific industries, and are hardly available as used machines.</p> <h2><strong>Working with a belt grinder</strong></h2> <p>Belt grinders are used for <strong><strong>wood, plastic and metalworking</strong></strong>. The quality of the grinding results depends on the limitations of the machine and the grinding tool. Therefore, it is important to check the material and the graininess of the grinding belt, to see if they fit the task. Belt grinders have a high torque, which is why very course belts <strong><strong>remove a high amount of material</strong></strong>. Belt grinders are preferably used to process solid materials. Removing old layers of colour, milling deburred or burnt metal pieces, or roughening metal or plastic panels are some of the most common uses of a belt grinder.</p> <h2><strong>Suppliers of belt grinders</strong></h2> <p>It is recommended to get hand-held belt grinders from established manufacturers of power hand tools. This includes METABO, BOSCH, HILTI or FEIN. Table belt grinders, or those placed on the table, are widely available in machine construction. The most recommended suppliers of these machines are METALLKRAFT, HOLZSTAR, SIMON and BOSCH. Long belt grinders are available from JANSSEN, SCHMID and GEO . Large machines for grinding heavy pre-products out of metal are available from LISSMAC.</p>"},{"id":"1606_en","content":""},{"id":"1607_en","content":""},{"id":"1609_en","content":"</p>\r\n<h2>Industrial Compressors Applications</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7280\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<a href=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/GRASSO_piston_compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-7280 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/GRASSO_piston_compressor-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"used 4 cylinder piston compressor\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">4 cylinder piston compressor</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>There are large indirect and direct risks associated with <strong>industrial compressors</strong>. Electrical shocks or fires caused by faulty insulation are a common occurrence when using this energy form. The development of power is also very limited. <strong>Hydraulic energy</strong> is the standard form of energy used for large and precise power generation. The hydraulic pump is usually electrically powered. Hydraulic operation is good for high amounts of power, but this means that the <strong>processing speed is low</strong>. Therefore,<strong> pneumatic power</strong> is the preferred method for <strong>processing and reforming small components</strong>. The disadvantage of pneumatic power is the high level of primary losses that occurs due to the compressibility of the air. This is the most expensive form of energy used for operation. However, it is still the most useful type of energy supply in industrial and manual work. It is a very efficient form of energy, particularly due to the high speeds that work stations can reach via pneumatic energy. The compressed air needed for pneumatic applications is supplemented by <strong>electrically operated compressors</strong>.</p>\r\n<h3>Structure of a Compressor</h3>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7278\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<a href=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/air_compressor_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-7278 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/air_compressor_1-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"used air compressor\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Industrial air compressors consist of different parts</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p><strong>Compressors</strong> have the same principle construction despite their different designs and sizes. An <strong>industrial compressor</strong> is made out of a compressed-air generating unit and an accumulator. Depending on their size, feet, rollers and boxes, compressors are usually mounted on a trailer. The <strong>compressed air generating unit</strong> – the actual compressor – is powered by an <strong>electric motor</strong>. The pressure is taken in by the compressor using a pipe. Pressure can be released, stored or monitored via a faucet. A pressure gauge is available to display how much pressure is available in the container. The <strong>accumulator</strong> is made out of a welded steel plate.</p>\r\n<p>There are two principle constructions available for the compressor device. The most common design is the <strong>reciprocating compressor</strong>. Similarly to a four-stroke engine, this type of compressor consists of a crankshaft, connecting rod, cylinder and vents. The air is sucked in during one stroke, compressed and then transferred to the accumulator.</p>\r\n<p>The second design has <strong>two screws that run into one another</strong>. When these are running, the space between the screws becomes smaller, which compresses the air even further. <a href=\"//trademachines.com/screw-compressor\"><strong>Screw compressors</strong></a> have a lot of advantages in relation to reciprocating compressors. The old technology of reciprocating compressors is gradually being replaced.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7281\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<a href=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/screw_compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-7281 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/screw_compressor-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Screw compressor in factory hall\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Screw Compressors are replacing old reciprocating compressors</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>All the advantages of a screw compressor are due to the differences in their construction. The screws that run into one another are the only part of the device that moves. Additionally, they can run contact-free, which reduces their wear and tear, energy demand and noise levels. Reciprocating air compressors are characterised by being very loud, which means that it is usually necessary to install these machines in a separate room. The numerous jerky components of a reciprocating compressor usually have a high level of wear and tear. Therefore, maintenance is usually very demanding and should not be neglected.</p>\r\n<p>Compressors have an <strong> internal compressed air sensor</strong>, which controls the engine. If the maximum amount of pressure is reached in the tank, then the air compressor will switch off automatically. If the boost pressure is reached then the compressor switches on again and builds up the pressure. Pressure gauges and compressed air sensors are two components, which are regularly checked by independent monitoring organisations. If either of these components are broken, then the tank can overload and burst. This has damaging consequences. <strong>Compressors</strong> are often installed outdoors for safety and noise reasons.</p>\r\n<h3>Applications for Air Compressors</h3>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7279\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7279 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/air_compressor_2-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"used air compressor\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Compressors can be used in small workshops large industrial facilities</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Compressors produce compressed air. They are used in small workshops for painting and blasting work and are used as a direct <strong>carrier for the applied substances</strong>. The air is the ideal carrier, which controls and hosts materials to be sprayed. Compressed air is used to <strong>clean components</strong> very well. Even hard to reach areas can be accessed and very well cleaned using the corresponding guns. A compressed air pipe with an attached gun is usually found in the close proximity to a<strong> cutting machine</strong> (e.g. <a href=\"//trademachines.com/milling-machines\"><strong>milling machines</strong></a>). Before working with this so-called air brush, the worker should be sufficiently briefed. Compressed air guns can cause great injuries, and even death, especially if used jokingly around bodily orifices. In addition to powering paint and blasting guns, compressed air is also used in workshops to power hand tools. Pneumatically operated welding, drilling and assembly tools are characterised as being particularly robust, not weighting much and having greater resilience in relation to electric tools. The main use of <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/air-compressors\">air compressors</a></strong> in an industry is to create compressed air for various pneumatically operated production machines. Pneumatically operated machines are a particularly safe option, when electric energy is not available. The main advantage of pneumatically operated processes are that they have high clock rates, they are consistently precise, and they are easy to install and operate.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_16153\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16153\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/atlas-copco-TP-compressor-300x289.jpg\" alt=\"Atlas Copco TP compressor\" width=\"300\" height=\"289\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">atlas Copco TP compressor</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Compressors are very easy to operate. They are ready for operation as soon as they are connected to electricity. If there is no electricity available, combined electricity and compressed air generators can be used. These are usually <strong>implemented on construction sites</strong>. In the construction sector, compressors are generally used to power caulking hammers. They are most commonly used for large machines. Jack hammers can often be used where caulking hammers are not suitable. It is particularly important to note that the accumulator does not get damaged. Blows from a hammer, knocking into the machine or components, or falls can turn the <strong>compressor for sale</strong> into a bomb. This occurs when the stored energy, in the form of pressure, is suddenly released. This has a very high risk of damage and injury. Generally,<strong> industrial air compressors for sale</strong> are very reliable and safe machines that can be economically and efficiently operated.</p>\r\n<h3>Used Compressors for Sale at Second Hand Market</h3>\r\n<p>Compressors are the back bone of every metal workshop, they are multi-functional and help with almost everything at the workshop.

On the other hand, an <strong>oil injected screw compressor</strong> uses the screw compressor oil to fill the spaces between the screws, providing a hydraulic seal as well as lubrication. Typically, a dry screw compressor will have a lower maximum pressure rating than an oil screw compressor. The compressed gas is then forced in one direction where, in the case of an oil injected screw compressor, it is separated from the screw compressor oil.</p> <h3>Single Screw Compressor</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_12951\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-12951 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/screw-air-compressor-300x182.jpg\" alt=\"screw compressor oil\" width=\"300\" height=\"182\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cooling and refrigerating is one of the uses of rotary screw compressors</figcaption></figure> <p>The rotary screw air compressor is not limited to a two screw design.

A reciprocating compressor commonly referred to as a <strong>piston air compressor</strong> is a positive displacement machine in which the compressing and displacing element is a piston having a reciprocating motion within a cylinder. Reciprocating compressors are capable of giving large pressure ratios but the mass handling capacity is limited or small. Reciprocating piston compressors may also be <strong>single acting compressor</strong> or<strong> double acting compressor</strong>.  Single acting compressor has one delivery stroke per revolution while in double acting there are two delivery strokes per revolution of the crank shaft.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9542\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9542 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/pc-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"4-cylinder piston compressor in a workshop\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">4-cylinder piston compressor</figcaption></figure> <h3><strong>Construction and Working of Piston Compressor</strong></h3> <p>The principal parts of a reciprocating piston compressor are: piston, cylinder, inlet valve, exit valve, connecting rod, crank, piston pin, crank pin and crank shaft. Inlet valve and exit valves used are of reed or plate type, which are either floating or clamped. Usually, <strong>backstops are provided to limit the valve displacement and may be of spring loaded type which get opened and closed due to pressure differential across them.</strong> The piston speed is decided by the valve type. When the compressor piston moves from the top to the bottom, suction pressure is created causing opening of inlet valve. With this opening of inlet valve and suction pressure the atmospheric air enters the cylinder. Air gets into cylinder during this stroke and is subsequently compressed in next stroke with both inlet valve and exit valve closed. This is the reason why both inlet and exit valves are of plate type and spring loaded so as to operate automatically as and when sufficient pressure difference is available to cause deflection in spring of the valve plates to open them. When the piston reaches the bottom, it reverses its motion and compresses the air inducted in previous stroke. if you are in need of an <a href=\"//trademachines.com/compressors\"><strong>air compressor for sale</strong></a> or a used piston compressor all these factors must come in consideration. knowing how a machine works makes buying more easy. </p> <figure id=\"attachment_9541\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9541 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/pc-2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Piston air compressor in use\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Piston air compressor in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <p>Compression is continued till the pressure of air inside becomes sufficient to cause deflection in exit valve.

width=\"300\" height=\"219\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ARIENS snow blower built like a mower</figcaption></figure> <h2>The Basics of SnowBlowers</h2> <p>One of the most interesting facts about these machines is that they are often used interchangeably with the term \"snow thrower\". In fact, this is incorrect. A<strong> snow thrower</strong> uses one process to remove the snow while a <strong>snowblower</strong> is involved with a two-stage process. There are numerous types of snow blowers available and one of the most common is a design which enables the user to walk behind; much in the same way that a <a href=\"//trademachines.com/push-lawn-mowers\"><strong>lawn mower</strong></a> is used. So, let us take a more in-depth look at how these units operate alongside some other key metrics as a <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/garden-and-urban-equipment\">garden machinery</a></strong></p> <p>As mentioned previously, the most important part of a snow blower is the blade (or horizontal auger) assembly. There are many different types of <strong>snowblowers</strong> such as residential units and industrial machines capable of removing tonnes of snow in a matter of minutes. The one major difference is that larger models can be <strong>powered by gas turbines or jet engines for extra \"throwing\" power.</strong> All will contain controls which are behind the main assembly. For the protection of the user, there may also be an emergency stop switch in the event that a foreign object becomes caught within the blade mechanism. A protective shield will surround the blades. This heightens levels of safety while allowing the operator to better see where he or she is clearing.</p> <h3>How Dose a Snow Blower Function?</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_18514\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-18514 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Snow-blower-working-300x154.jpg\" alt=\"used snow blower at work\" width=\"300\" height=\"154\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The snow blower motor cuts the snow and blow it away</figcaption></figure> <p>The basic principle behind the majority of <strong>snow blowers</strong> currently on the market is the same. A set of angled augers will rapidly spin and capture the surface snow. In turn, the snow will be displaced from its original position. Thus, the user has much more flexibility when clearing a path. Many designs will also have a chute which is attached to the auger. This allows for greater directional control when moving the snow out of the way. In more robust <strong>commercial snowblowers</strong>, a two-stage process can be employed. This consists of a second auger mechanism built within the chute. Such a method will further granulate the material before it is blown out. For those who live in environments that receive a substantial amount of snow each year, this design is generally preferred. In more detail and as mentioned previously, the motor can be powered by a standard electrical supply or it can use diesel fuel (as opposed to petrol) for its operation. Using a rotating mechanism in the <strong>snow blower</strong>, a blade (in the shape of a paddle) rotates outward and picks up snow during this motion. In some <strong>snowblowers on sale</strong>, this blade is fastened directly to the engine while in other designs is it connected through a system of belts and pulleys. Either way, the action is the same. The <strong>snow is removed and displaced a few feet or more from the path which is intended to be cleared.</strong></p> <h3>Where is a Snowblower Used?</h3> <p></p> <p>Obviously,<strong> snowblower</strong> is used within environments that can expect to receive regular snow during the winter and which are subject to a high level of foot traffic. It is still important to note that different riding snow blowers are intended to be used within specific conditions. The <strong>electric snowblowers</strong> are considered to be less powerful than the <strong>gas snow blowers</strong> or their diesel counterparts. Snow that is generally not deeper than four inches (ten centimeters) can be handled by these units. Diesel-powered blowers are able to accommodate much deeper snow. A snowblower is equipped to handle snow which is light and fluffy. Should it be compacted, extremely wet or is layered with ice, the auger mechanism may not be able to break through the material and send it down the chute. Also, there are chances of the chute itself becoming clogged. Most manufacturers will specify the conditions for each <strong>blower for sale</strong> and it is therefore best to speak with a professional to select the ideal option.</p> <h3>What are the Main Safety Issues when Looking at Used Snow blower Sale Items?</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_18507\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-18507 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/JOHN-DEERE-snowblower-for-truck-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"JOHN DEERE snowblower for tractor for sale\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">JOHN DEERE snowblower attcachment for garden tractor</figcaption></figure> <p>It should be obvious that the most important safety issue revolves around the augers and blades involved in the extraction process. These can be quite dangerous and there have been some instances of personal injuries. This is particularly the case if the auger becomes jammed with snow. Should a user not deactivate the machine and attempt to clear this snow by hand, the mechanism could reengage and cause potentially grievous bodily harm. However, there are several innovations which mitigate the chances of this occurring. Most modern <strong>used snowblowers</strong>  such as the popular <strong>ARIENS snow blowers</strong> contain a device known as a \"dead man's switch\". This will immediately deactivate the unit when the controls are not physically engaged (such as a toggle or hand-operated lever). Secondly, when looking for <strong>blowers for sale</strong>, make sure these machines will also have a plastic tool that can be used to safely clear any clogs without risking damage to one's hands or to the machine.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_24077\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-24077\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/TORO-Power-Max-snow-blower-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"Used toro snow blower\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TORO Power Max snow blower</figcaption></figure> <h3>Major Snow Blower Manufacturers</h3> <p>Like many machines, there are indeed no two snowblowers which are made alike. It is always best to choose the top brands in the industry. Not only will this help to guarantee the safety of the snow blower, but it is also likely that a warranty will be included in terms of parts, labour or a breakdown. Some of the <strong>best snow blowers</strong> used these days come from manufacturers such as ARIENS,YAMAHA, WESTA, CRAFTSMAN, LOFTNESS snowblowers for sale  TORO, TROY-BILT and YARD Machines. Every manufacturer has its own speciality and some of the most popular manufacturers can answer on most of your requirements such as the JOHN DEERE snowblower and HONDA snowblowers.</p> <h4>Used blowers - Things to Consider</h4> <p>Above all, it is important to mention that each of these brands is likely to supply a number of different subcategories such as<strong> </strong>electric blowers, gas snow blowers, and one- or two-stage systems (in regards to the number of augers mentioned earlier). By understanding how these <strong>snow blowers</strong> operatethe best, it is much easier to make the best choices when looking for <strong>used snow blowers for sale</strong>.</p> <p><img

Chain driven trencher equipment consists of a large belt or digging chain which is stretched around a curved frame, usually made of metal, called a boom. This type is sometimes called a <strong>chainsaw trenchers</strong>. The boom can be altered to different angles, allowing trenches of varying sizes to be cut. When in use, the trencher chain turns on the boom as the machine moves forward, removing soil and debris to form the trench. A wheel trencher (as the name suggests), is fitted with a toothed metal wheel instead of a chain and operates by biting into the earth in incremental chunks as it proceeds.</p> <h2>Varying sizes available</h2> <p>From smaller hand held trencher or portable trencher options through to enormous wire trencher and rock trencher options, there are a number of different sizes available. As trenchers undertake tasks as diverse as quarrying and road repairs, it’s essential to select the one which is appropriate for the job in hand. The specialist nature of this plant means that there are few generic options available, which is why trenchers hire or finding an affordably priced used trencher for sale is often a good alternative to purchasing a new item.

Generally wheel trenchers are more suited to environments where rocks or tree roots abound, whilst a tractor trencher provides <strong>superb tool for work in challenging, muddy conditions</strong>. Many companies opt for a skid steer trencher that enables close observation of the work whilst still keeping the operative safely elevated. Smaller enterprises frequently make use of a trenchers attachment, which can be used with a tractor or other plant when needed, then removed so that another attachment may be utilised.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Working with trenchers</h2> <p>The complex and dangerous nature of working with this type of equipment means that appropriate training is essential, particularly in an industrial environment. Luckily using smaller skid steer trenching equipment (a bobcat)is relatively straight-forward, particularly if operatives already have experience of using <strong>skid steer machines</strong> for other digging or loading tasks. A large cable trencher or one used for excavation in high risk environments requires significant amounts of training to use safely, both in terms of machine operation and also awareness of variables which may present a significant danger, such as unexpected obstacles or unstable ground.</p> <h2>Trenching Machine manufacturers</h2> <p>There are several major suppliers of trencher plant, including DITCH WITCH, DIGGA, MARAIS and the VERMEER company. There is a large second hand market for items from these suppliers, due to both the high value of the products and also their incredible durability; with the right care many of these machines will last for decades, so a used DITCH WITCH trencher, for example, could still have years of useful life in it. Whether you opt for a walk behind trencher for sale or a different model, used plant is frequently a cost-effective solution to your trenching needs.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full

class=\"wp-caption-text\">An Electric Chainsaw with power cable and cover</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Chainsaws - Forestry Equipment</h3>\n<p>A <strong>hand chain saw</strong> is predominantly used for cutting trees, such as when preparing firewood, processing pulp or performing tree surgery. There are two general types of <strong>chainsaw for sale</strong>: the <strong>electric chainsaw</strong> and the <strong>petrol chainsaw</strong>. Both work by harnessing their respective sources of power to rotate a chainsaw chain around a guide bar, which can come in different lengths. To aid the sawing action, the chains have cutting teeth on their outer surface of varying styles. For instance, the curled and alternating “chipper teeth” chainsaw blade is a popular choice for many due to its robustness in dirty and abrasive conditions. <strong>Chainsaw chain types can also come in a range of pitches</strong> (half the length of three rivets) and gauges (drive-link thickness), as well as tooth-spacing arrangements such as the conventional setup of one blade for every two links. The petrol chain saw uses an internal combustion engine similar to those found in <a href=\"//trademachines.com/cars\"><strong>cars</strong></a>, but with a much simpler one cylinder setup that performs a two-stroke action. Electric brands are powered by an electric motor. In both types, the power is driven by a centrifugal clutch, which allows the <strong>chain saw</strong> to stay running when not in use, and a sprocket-wheel over which the chain rotates at the base of the guide bar. Over the years, the safety of <strong>chainsaws</strong> has progressed considerably with the introduction of anti-vibration chainsaw chains, chainbrake systems and an improved overall design, reducing accidents and saving lives.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Chainsaws for Professional and Amateur Settings</span></h4>\n<p>Because of the range of <strong>chain saws</strong> available and the improved protective features, chainsaws can be operated safely in a number of settings by users with varying experience, whether for <a href=\"//trademachines.com/forestry-harvesters\"><strong>forest harvesting</strong></a> or pruning trees. For work in a garden, there are small chainsaw options as well as brands with shortened guidebars and less-powerful engines, ideal for felling small trees or clearing branches quickly. The reduced power of an <strong>electric chain saw</strong> makes it the <strong>best chainsaw</strong> for these applications. There is also a range of chainsaw parts and accessories available for extra protection including goggles, clothing and hearing protectors. In a more professional setting, cutting thick tree trunks in a forest will require a powerful engine and longer guide bar. <strong>For applications such as the limbing or felling of large trees often required for forestry work, the best chainsaw is often a petrol chainsaw model.</strong></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_16190\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-16190\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/stihl-chainsaw.jpg\" alt=\"stihl chainsaw\" width=\"400\" height=\"151\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">STIHL chainsaw</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Chainsaw operators will also prefer certain types of chainsaw chains for particular jobs, such as low vibration options while working up trees. To suit certain jobs, there are a variety <strong>chainsaw parts</strong> you can buy to modify your machine. A <strong>pole chain saw</strong>, for instance, is an adapted model and the best chain saw for reaching otherwise inaccessible branches. For one-handed operation, the top handle chainsaw is designed for use up a tree in reaching further than you would normally be able to with two hands, similar to the pole chainsaw.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">The Structure of the Chainsaw</span></h4>\n<p>The basic components to a chainsaw include an engine, sprocket, centrifugal clutch, guide bar, saw chain and tension adjuster, as well as a rear or upper handle. The engine will be either electric or gas chain saw powered. In a <strong>gas chain saw</strong>, the back of the machine houses the fuel tank, engine, carburettor box and spark plug. The carburettor and spark plug are vital components to the combustion process in a petrol chainsaw engine. An <strong>electric chain saw</strong> will contain an electric motor at the back of the machine and a cord leading to a power source, unless it is a cordless <strong>electric chainsaws</strong>. At the front of a chainsaw is the guide bar, which is usually made of alloy steel to protect against wear. The guide bar can come in a number of lengths ranging from 40 cm to a lengthy 90cm, depending on the type of sawing job. The saw chain rotates around the guide bar when in operation, as well as the sprocket that is housed under the chain tensioner. The purpose of the chain tensioner is to allow the user to adjust the tension in the chain so that it doesn’t come loose or bind with the chain saw. To <strong>protect from cutting yourself, best chainsaws for sale will have a rear and upper handle guard.</strong></p>\n<h3>Uses Chainsaw for Sale at Second hand Market</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_16203\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-16203\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/chainsaw-300x151.jpg\" alt=\"used chainsaws for sale\" width=\"300\" height=\"151\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chainsaws are a must when handling wood products</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of the many used <strong>chainsaws</strong> <strong>on sale</strong> throughout the world, one of the best and well known are the <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/manufacturer/stihl\">STIHL </a></strong>chainsaws and they are known for generating the best chainsaw sales and chainsaw reviews. Also, used STIHL chainsaws can be purchased without a any problems.

Small, electric machines are available for average domestic use, and petrol engine professional models are used for larger jobs such as sports fields.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11673\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11673 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/Scarifiers-300x146.jpg\" alt=\"Manual scarifier working grassland\" width=\"300\" height=\"146\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Manual scarifier removing thatch</figcaption></figure> <h4>Why It's Necessary To Use A Garden Scarifier</h4> <p>Lawns can become gradually suffocated by a layer of grass cuttings, moss, leaves, rhizomes, lateral weed growth and other organic matter which finds its way onto the surface of the soil around the stems of the grass. This layer is known as thatch and it can restrict the penetration of the water, minerals and other nutrients that grass requires to be as healthy as possible. In time this can lead to a decline in the appearance and wellbeing of the grass. This problem can be addressed by scarifying the surface and subsurface of the grass by means of penetrating metal blades, prongs or tines which remove the built up layers of thatch. The removal of thatch encourages thicker grass growth and results in a firmer lawn that is less susceptible to disease and which allows water, air and nutrients to penetrate to the root zone. Additionally, lowering the grass scarifier and allowing it to break the soil surface will open it up and allow it to become a receptive bed for grass seed. The <strong>scarifying machine</strong> you need will depend on the nature of the job at hand. A very small area of grass can easily be scarified manually using a scarifying rake. However, this can be an exhausting job on a fair sized lawn, so this is where an electric scarifier comes in handy. A <strong>scarifier aerator</strong> will penetrate the surface of the soil, breaking up compacted areas and allowing the easier access of water, nutrients and essential microbial life. If you have a large lawn, you might wish to <strong>consider using a petrol scarifier</strong>. Professionals taking care of sports fields will prefer a scarifier that can be towed along behind  <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/sit-on-mowers\">riding lawnmowers</a></strong> or lawn tractors.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11668\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-11668 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/lawn-Scarifier-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"Lawn scarifier in garden\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Electric lawn scarifier</figcaption></figure> <h2>Why Not Look For Used Lawn Scarifiers For Sale At Auction?</h2> <p>You might be surprised at what a wide selection of lawn rakers &amp; scarifiers can be found on online auction sites. Such sites allow you to have a good, wide overview of <strong>scarifiers for sale</strong>, so that you can pick and choose the brand and model that's right for you. Additionally, used lawn rakes and scarifiers can be had at a fraction of the cost of buying new, meaning that you can add to your <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/garden-and-urban-equipment\">collection of garden equipment</a></strong> at a relatively modest outlay and keep your grass looking great all the year round.</p> <h2>The Leading Brands Of Scarifiers</h2> <p>The <strong>FLYMO Compact 3400 Electric Lawnraker</strong> is a great choice for a smaller lawn, being light and easy to use. This lawn rake scarifier is often rated as the best of its kind. Other top notch electric lawn scarifiers include those produced by <strong>BOSCH, ALKO and WOLF-GARTEN</strong>, companies who boast excellent reputations and whose products are highly prized on online gardening equipment auctions. Moving on to makes of petrol scarifier, the <strong>EINHELL BG-SC 2240P Petrol Lawn Scarifier</strong> offers 18 double sided blades and a 45 litre catching box. <strong>DORI and EFCO</strong> are two more companies whose products in this range are highly respected.

grass</figcaption></figure> <h2>How Do Forage Wagons Work?</h2> <p>There are <strong>two types of wagon</strong> available; the first is pulled alongside the harvester using a tractor and the second is attached to the back of a self-propelled harvester. When plants are cut, they are blown up a chute and into the wagon, where they are stored until the wagon is full and then emptied into a silo.</p> <h2>What To Look For When Buying A Wagon</h2> <p>When looking at a <strong>forage wagon for sale</strong>, it is important to note the size, price and whether or not it is compatible with equipment that is already in use on the farm. Some are designed to be pulled along, whilst others are meant to be attached to the back of other machines; newer wagons often have automatic unloading, but tend to be more expensive than those that don't.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8950\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8950\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/fw-2-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"Forage wagon attached\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forage wagon at a farm</figcaption></figure> <h2>The Benefits Of Buying A Used Forage Wagon</h2> <p>The cost of new machines can sometimes be prohibitive, which is why it is better to look for <strong>used forage wagons for sale</strong> instead. Not only are they kinder to the wallet, but they allow farmers to see if a wagon is a worthwhile investment without much initial financial outlay.</p> <h2>Forage Wagon Manufacturers</h2> <p>The following manufacturers produce forage wagons: KRONE, CLAAS, SCHUITEMAKER, POTTINGER, MEYER Manufacturing and JOHN DEERE.</p></p>"},{"id":"6984_en","content":""},{"id":"6976_en","content":""},{"id":"6985_en","content":""},{"id":"6991_en","content":""},{"id":"6997_en","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A slitter machine cuts rolls of material into narrower sections for various industries.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">A Slitting Machine</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Slitting machinery is used for shearing large rolls of a particular material, in a method known as “roll slitting,” into thinner sections. The process of creating narrower rolls can be achieved by unwinding, cutting and rewinding the material - known as rewind slitting - or by simply slicing the roll as it is. The former method is completed using a slitting and rewinding machine such as a steel coil slitting machine.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">The Slitter Setup</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">In general, a coil slitting machine will consist of an uncoiler, a slitter and a recoiler for rewinding the newly cut rolls. The type of material will determine the kind of blade and cutting technique used for the slitting and rewinding machine. Steel slitter machine solutions, for instance, use complementary cutting rolls for slicing hard materials, while razors are often used on slitter machine options that cut softer materials such as plastic.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><span>Slitting Machine </span>Types</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A slitting machine for sale can be classed as a roll slitting machine or a coil slitting machine. The latter cuts materials in an unravelled form – also known as a slitter rewinder machine - while the former uses a powerful cutting device to slice the roll. These machines can come in all shapes and sizes; small roll slitters may be used to cut paper for receipts or lottery tickets, while larger varieties can cut harder materials such as with a metal slitting machine or a bopp tape slitting machine, which is used to slit rolls of plastic for packaging operations.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Areas of Industry</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The converters industry use slitting cutter machines extensively for the manufacturing of laminate and print materials. A bopp tape slitting machine is often used by food packaging companies within this industry, slitting the material with a slitter rewinder machine or roll slitting machine.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Manufacturers to Look Out For</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">ALS is a well-known manufacturer of manual and automatic log slitters for cutting films and tapes. In the UK, you'll often find a slitting machine for sale from Atlas or ASHE, who both provide solutions for the conversion, paper and web industries. The Chinese firm Hangzhou produce steel coil slitting machine solutions often found at used slitting machine auctions in the low slitting machine price bands. Other manufacturers include Taiwan-based HCI Converting Equipment, SRG International, B.R.D, Caple, Uflex, Ocean Extrusions and ITL Industries.</p>"},{"id":"6988_en","content":""},{"id":"6990_en","content":""},{"id":"6989_en","content":"<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are centrifuges and what are they used for?</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A </span><b>centrifuge</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a device responsible for the </span><b>separation of fluids or gas</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The device applies a sustained centrifugal force (centrifugal force is an inertial force and appears when an object is moving in a curved path). Each centrifuge has got a </span><b>spinning vessel</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which at a high speed pushes denser materials to the outside. The materials which are less dense are moved to the center. A washing machine, that pushes outside the excess of water from clothes, is also an example of a centrifuge.

400\">with or without electric drive used to transport pallets and other heavy equipment on a firm, level surface. Pallet trucks are a universal and flexible means of transport, therefore they are in great demand in a wide variety of industrial sectors. They are comfortable, manoeuvrable and very easy to operate. Since they produce little noise when being pulled or pushed, they are also suitable for quiet zones. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A hand pallet truck weighs less than 100 kg, but its load capacity is up to 3 t. Some models are equipped with </span><b>mobile weighing devices</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and ensure precise weighing. In addition, most hand pallet trucks have individually </span><b>adjustable forks</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with different </span><b>fork lengths</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, so you can easily adapt them to your needs. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All types of pallet trucks use integrated hydraulics to lift the load. A hydraulic cylinder actuated by a long lever handle (drawbar) enables the lift truck to be steered and lifted in relation to the rollers. The up and down movement of the drawbar drives the hydraulic pump. </span></p>\r\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-33457 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/11/hand-pallet-track-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"hand pallet truck for sale\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></h3>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where are hand pallet trucks used?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hand pallet trucks are the perfect solution for a variety of transport tasks that have to be carried out daily over short distances.

In contrast to standard shapes, special models (such as scissor lift trucks) also allow the loading of large shelves or machines, as these can lift the transported goods to greater heights. Additional equipment such as an</span><b> integrated weighing system</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, for example, supports work in order picking, especially in large companies.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where can I buy a used pallet truck?</span></h2>\r\n<p><b>Used pallet trucks</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of excellent quality can be purchased at pallet truck </span><b>auctions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

Thanks to their agile nature, they are perfect for usage in environments that are harder for bigger machines to access and navigate, such as </span><b>construction sites</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

This makes them an integral part of the shipping and distribution industries, but they are also used in any industry that requires heavy loads to be moved.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The application of a terminal tractor is similar to that of shunting locomotives in railway operations, which are intended for journeys within a railway station - namely for shunting wagons.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As shunt trucks are not required to go out onto public roads, they tend to be slow moving. This kind of truck can only reach speeds of up to 25 miles per hour. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A terminal tractor includes many features, like 4x4 wheel drive and a high torque diesel engine, which enables it to move exceedingly heavy loads. Unlike with a traditional tractor, the driver’s seat its offset to the left of the engine.</span></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33581 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/12/terminal-tractors-300x163.jpg\" alt=\"Terminal Tractors\" width=\"300\" height=\"163\" /></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where are terminal tractors used?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Terminal tractors are used in many sectors, i.e. in </span><b>ports, logistics centres, distribution</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><b>industry sites</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In ports, terminal tractors are very often used to load and unload</span><b> RoRo ships</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. RoRo (roll on, roll off) is a method for transporting vehicles and machinery. It is very similar to a ferry and it means that cars, trucks, trailers etc. roll on and off the ship, as opposed to being lifted. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Terminal tractors are also popular in logistics and distribution centres, where they are used for a quick transfer of semi-trailers and container chassis. Thanks to their excellent manoeuvrability they are perfect in distribution terminals.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition, the terminal tractors are characterised by their high towing capacity and robust construction, which is why they are very popular, especially in industry sites (mainly in the metallurgy sector: foundries, steel works, etc.). The heavy loads are transported on roller trailers with iron wheels. </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Terminal tractor and its components</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Terminal tractors have a very characteristic design:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Driver's cab</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for only one person. In some vehicle models, the driver's seat unit and steering wheel can be rotated 180 degrees. </span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Robust chassis</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with a short wheelbase of about 3 metres.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Height-adjustable fifth wheel</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> designed for a lifting capacity of 40 tonnes. The fifth wheel plate can be adjusted by the driver from the cab using a joystick.  </span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Diesel engine</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, usually with automatic transmission.

It differs from other constructions because its <strong>main spindle lies on the vertical axis</strong>. It is a highly automatic machine, characteristically due to its tool magazine, automatic tool changer, tool storage unit and its numerically controlled rotating work table. The single column and console design are the most common types of horizontal machining centres. However, the highly rigid gantry construction is best suited for vertical positioning of the work spindle. This is most commonly found on vertical machine centers. Universal machining centres allow for flexibility, as the main spindle’s position can be adjusted.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_9721\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9721 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/cnc-vertical-machining-center-300x164.jpg\" alt=\"metal before milling in a vertical cnc machine center\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vertical CNC machining center before milling process</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<h2>History of the Vertical Machining Centers</h2>\r\n<p>Historically, the vertical position of the spindle was a typical feature of the single spindle drilling machine. The machining centre was then developed based on this design, through the integration of additional machining processes and the introduction of numerical control. On a drilling machine, the vertical position of the main spindle ensures that the force of the feed operates in the same direction as the weight of the workpiece. This means that the clamp only has to absorb the rotational force of the tool. This is a significant advantage particularly for <strong>multi-faceted machining centers that also undertake milling work</strong>.</p>\r\n<h2>Vertical Machining Centers &amp; Areas of Applications</h2>\r\n<p>The horizontal machining centre is usually better suited than the corresponding machine tool with a vertical work spindle, for the majority of common processing tasks. Typical areas of application for vertical machine centers include the <strong>production of castings, moulds, stamps, matrices and other similar components.</strong> What is important is that these large and heavy workpieces are processed in one direction. The gantry design is particularly suited to process these types of workpieces; there are two different designs available.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_9724\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9724 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/5-axis-vertical-machining-centre-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"5 axis vertical machining center while drilling\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boring in a vertical machine center</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>The long table design contains a translational movement axis. This construction requires a machine bed, which is double the length of the table. With the gantry design, the tool storage contains all the movement axes and the bed does not have to be longer than the longest section of the workpiece. The gantry design is particularly stable because of its cross-beam and double column design. This allows for a high cutting capacity, which as a consequence, inflicts a high demand upon the frame.</p>\r\n<h2>Vertical Machining Centres as a Tools Changing Device</h2>\r\n<p>An essential component of the vertical machining centre is its automatic tool changing device. This requires a suitable tool storage system and it is usually necessary to code the tools so that they can be identified by the machines. <strong>Disc, chain or shelf magazines can be implemented as a tool storage, depending on the number of tools required.</strong> The typical storage capacity of a shelf magazine is double that of a disc magazine. There is usually a limited amount of space available for labelling the tools. Optical labelling systems like barcodes are usually not suitable because they are susceptible to dirt. Non-volatile semi conductor memory provides a high resistance with smaller sizes, particularly in conjunction with non-contact data transmission. Vertical machining centres commonly use steep taper tools, where the data is stored in the groove or clamp bolt. These electronic data storage units are not only used to store a large amount of data, but they also contain a code. These are used for identification purposes, as well as storing specific data relating to the tool, like its running life or corrective action.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_9726\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9726 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/tool-magazine-machine-center-300x162.jpg\" alt=\"Tool magazine with different tools for vertical machining centres\" width=\"300\" height=\"162\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tool magazine for independent tool feed</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p>Another important characteristic for automatic production using vertical machining centres is the <strong>independent tool feed, which is usually undertaken using a pallet system</strong>. Both the tools and the pallets need to be identified by the vertical machining centre. Unlike the tools, there is enough space available on the pallets for barcodes and similar coding systems.</p>\r\n<p>Sheet metal machining centres are also available within the <strong>category of vertical machining centers</strong>. They are most commonly used to process thin workpieces with large surface areas. These are best processed using an arrangement of tools found on vertical machining centres. However, the tools used are significantly different than those previously described and a work spindle is not available for, for example, laser cutting. A rotating punch can be used as an analogy for a punching tool, which is a typical tool for a sheet metal machining centres.</p>\r\n<h2>Vertical Machining Center Manufacturers</h2>\r\n<p>The most well-known manufacturers of vertical machining centres include CHIRON, DIXI, DMG MORI SEIKI (formerly DECKEL, MAHO and GILDEMEISTER), HECKERT, HERMLE, HÜLLER-HILLE, HURCO, MAKINO, OKUMA and SHW.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n"},{"id":"1292_en","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">What is a horizontal machining center?</h2>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_9908\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9908\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/horizontal-machining-center.jpg\" alt=\"A Horizontal Machining Center from SCHARMANN\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">SCHARMANN Ecocut 1Z Horizontal Machining Center</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A horizontal machining centre is a cutting machine used for wood, plastic and metal processing. A horizontal machining center can mill a desired contour and shapes out of a block of raw material.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Where are horizontal machining centers used?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A horizontal machine center in the metalworking industry is primarily used for machine construction. The workpieces that are produced using this machine are usually special components for complex machines. The series production of components using a forming process (die casting) is not economical due to the manufacturing technology, and the insufficient number of components. Therefore, they are usually produced individually on horizontal machining centres. In wood and plastic processing, a horizontal machining center is the only machine, which can produce complex contours on raw material. In addition to technical applications, horizontal machining centers, including horitontal CNC machining centers, are used to produce designer pieces.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_9910\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9910\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/cnc-horizontal-machining-center.jpg\" alt=\"DMG Horizontal Machining Center\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">DECKEL MAHO DMC 80 H hi-dyn Horizontal Machining Center</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">How does a horizontal machining center work?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A horizontal machining center consists of a work table, upon which the workpiece is clamped. A milling tool with a quickly rotating spindle is used to mill out the desired contour on the workpiece. Horizontal machining centers differ from one another in their work axes. Three axes is usually the minimum configuration. 5 axis horizontal machining centers are the most frequently used machining centers.  The number of work axes can be expanded with a swinging device on the spindle or a turning device on the worktable. Extensive machining processes can be undertaken on a horizontal machining centre with a tool changer. In addition to broaching and finishing, deburring and polishing are also possible on these machines. A CNC horizontal machining center is controlled via a programme. This is written directly into the machine or created on a computer and entered via an interface.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A high level of expertise is required for operating a used horizontal machining center. As a cutting machine, this machine produces a large amount of waste. Because the milling tool often cuts hard metal, the strain can lead to a high amount of wear and tear. Therefore, a horizontal machining center for sale needs to be regularly cleaned and controlled. With series components, it is important to continuously monitor the production tolerances. If detected early enough, the inserts can be replaced and the desired precision of the used CNC horizontal machining center can be restored.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n"},{"id":"1288_en","content":""},{"id":"1295_en","content":"<h2>Use of a Press Brake Machine</h2>\r\n<p>A metal press brake is most commonly used to produce a single or multiple layered sheet of metal. Complex profiles can be produced because the sheet is inserted into the press brake machine at an angle to the fold. <strong>The layered or folded sheets are used in automobile construction</strong>, the construction of cabinets, or to waterproof sandwich panels. Therefore, every company that produces sandwich panels (e.g. Hoesch, Siegerland Werke or Fischer Profil) always has a department, which is responsible for the bending of finished plates. Body repair shops usually have manually operated press brakes. Using these machines, skilled workers can manually repair complexly formed sheets, such as the edges of doors or the sill of automobiles.</p>\r\n<h2>Function of a Press Brake Dies and Punches</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7729\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7729 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/pb-1-300x209.jpg\" alt=\"metal press brake\" width=\"300\" height=\"209\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of the many uses of press brakes is in the car industry</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>A press brake only has a few interchangeable tools, which are made up out of V-shaped wedges that are several meters long and a fitting groove. The punch and press brake dies and pushed together with high pressure. The wedge is used usually called a “punch” and the groove is called a “die”. The sheet metal, which is placed between these two components, is then uniformly shaped into the desired form. <strong>The tracks, upon which the profile of the angle is attached, can be switched.</strong> Thereby, several different types of angles can be produced with one press brake. The most common way to control the bending of the angles on a press brake is by adjusting its strokes. The sheet metal is bent constantly in relation to the depth of the punch. The stroke of the tracks can always be stopped. The predetermined angle is always the smallest possible, which is adjustable with the profiles used on the metal press brake.</p>\r\n<h2>Structure of a Hydraulic Press Brake</h2>\r\n<p>A hydraulic press brake is made out of a machine support frame, a lifting unit, controls and an engine. Small press brakes usually have a frame made out of a welded steel tube construction. Larger press brakes require a frame made out of cast iron so that they can safety absorb all the force, tension and vibrations that occur during processing. A press brake is either operated hydraulically, mechanically or pneumatically. Pneumatic press brakes are only used for very small products, like window frames or rails used in mechanics. The type of engine also determines what thickness of sheet metal can be processed. Particularly powerful hydraulically operated press brakes can process sheet metal that is up to several centimeters thick. However, <strong>the use of hydraulic press brake is only possible in certain situations and cannot be done with every angle</strong>. Press brakes can either be controlled manually or using CNC control. An additional feed is required for a CNC press brake. Press brakes with this feed can then be used to process larger numbers. It is useful to check whether a roll forming system would be more suitable for processing thin-walled sheet metal profiles. The larger the press brake, the bigger the lifting unit. With a really big structure, warpages and contortions can be effectively fixed. Thereby, a brake press for sale has to be regularly checked for dimensional accuracy. Sometimes a cement foundation is required for really large press brake machines.</p>\r\n<h2>Safety Precautions for a Press Brake</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7835\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7835 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/pb-21-300x195.jpg\" alt=\"automatic press brake\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Press brakes shape metal sheets fully automatically</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Manually operated press brakes contain an extra safety system. Press brakes often cause hand injuries because the sheet metal is manually guided through the machine. A few years ago, a two-handed release system was made a standard safety requirement. However, these have been found to be unpractical for many reasons. <strong>Above all, it significantly slowed down the processing time, which means that the safety system was often deliberately overridden</strong>. In order to ensure quicker processing times without compromising safety, optical systems are used today that are based on laser technology. Thereby, the workpiece can be continually guided through to the bending unit and the process can be stopped with a foot pedal.</p>\r\n<h2>Buying Used Press Brakes</h2>\r\n<p>The choice of using a second hand press brake depends on where and how it will be implemented. The force and matrix size are more important factors than the dimension of a press brake, in contrast with manual press brake. The force is usually measured in tonnes (t) or kilo newtons (kN). Press brakes are standard machines used for sheet metal processing. <strong>The used market offers a large choice of high quality used press brakes for sale, especially used hydraulic press brake and CNC press brake for sale</strong>. It is worth testing and measuring press brakes from the 1970s or 1980s. It is always recommended to purchase a brake press machine that is 20-40% bigger than what you require, irregardless of whether it is a new or used machine. A higher level of flexibility can be offered to customers when working with a powerful used brake press. Additionally, tools with small dimensions have lower wear and tear after extended periods of use. Stainless steel is much more resistant to bending, especially in relation to white or copper sheets with the same material thickness. For producers of components of machine covers, an appropriately sized press brake can be incorporated into the machining programme, to process these materials. With little investment it is thereby possible to produce rustproof, non-magnetic cover components that do not have a coating. It is possible to always find a press brake for sale of a similar price with more power due to the large number of machines available on the second-hand market.</p>\r\n<h2>Accessories for Press Brakes</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_7731\" style=\"width: 232px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7731\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/pb-3-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"press brake\" width=\"232\" height=\"179\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Also possible: Shaping of big metal sheets</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>Press brakes are used to process the edges of sheet metal efficiently and precisely. These have to be transported to the bending process, and then the finished products have to be transported away. For the manually operated press brakes, the use of bending aids and equipment lifters is very useful. Bending aids are additional supports upon which very large sheet metal workpieces can be placed for processing, without the risk of them sagging, bending or falling off. Equipment lifters are useful tools, which lift packets of sheet metal to the height required for processing. Thereby, the operator does not have to undertake the laborious task of bending down and lifting heavy workpieces. <strong>For particularly large and heavy sheet metal pieces, using a small mobile crane with a lifting unit (suction cup or magnet) is a great help.</strong></p>\r\n<h2>Working with a Press Brake Tooling</h2>\r\n<p>Thin-walled sheet metal is usually processed using a press brake. These have particularly sharp edges and corners. The most common injury is a cut resulting from coming in contact with the edge of the sheet metal. Therefore, it is necessary to wear cut resistant gloves and cut resistant clothes when working with a used press brake tooling. <strong>The minimum requirement for the workspace is a leather apron, to protect the operator’s chest and legs against sharp edged sheet metal.</strong></p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Working with a press brake requires a briefing and some practice. Official training is usually not required. Unlike working with punches and presses, the bending of sheet metal is more suited for unskilled workers.</p>\r\n<h2>Suppliers of Press Brakes</h2>\r\n<p>Particularly recommended suppliers of press brakes include MENGELE, LOTZE, DARLEY, AMADA, PROMECAM, TRUMPF and HACO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13436\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/amada-press-brake.jpg\" alt=\"amada press brake\" width=\"1114\" height=\"691\" /></p>\r\n"},{"id":"1294_en","content":"<figure id=\"attachment_8225\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8225\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/smwe-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Press brake\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Press brake for production of lengthy, thin sheet metal parts</figcaption></figure> <h2>Sheet Metal Machine Tools Used for Processing Sheets</h2> <p><strong>Sheet metal working</strong> was already done in earlier times when the task of processing metal began.

The transition to using sheet metal machines came about with the <strong>development</strong> of <strong>rolling mills</strong> in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, which were used for sheet metal equipment manufacturing. <strong>Presses</strong> are the <strong>key component</strong> of <strong>sheet metal machines.</strong> The newest developments of the 20<sup>th</sup> century are thermal and laser cutting machines, which are used to separate sheet metal.</p> <table class=\"alignright\" style=\"height: 259px;background-color: #ffffff\" border=\"1\" width=\"419\"> <tbody> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"341\"> <h5><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong>TRUMPF TruBend Series 3000 Press Brake Specs</strong></span></em></h5> </td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\"> </td> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong>TruBend 3100</strong></span></td> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong>TruBend 3066</strong></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Press force</strong></td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">1000 kN</td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">660 kN</td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Bending length</strong></td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">3060 mm</td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">2040 mm</td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Width between columns</strong></td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">3384 mm</td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">2364 mm</td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Usable installation height</strong></td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">430* mm</td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">430* mm</td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Rapid speed</strong></td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">200 mm/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">200 mm/s</td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Max. working speed</strong></td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">15 mm/s</td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">15 mm/s</td> </tr> <tr> <td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Control</strong></td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">T3500T Multi-Touch</td> <td style=\"text-align: center\">T3500T Multi-Touch</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Applications Areas used in Metal Sheet Working Machinery</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_23842\" style=\"width: 673px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-23842 size-full\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/TRUMPF-sheet-metal-working-press-brake.jpg\" alt=\"TRUMPF sheet metal working press brake\" width=\"673\" height=\"505\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TRUMPF sheet metal working /press brake from the TruBend Series 3000</figcaption></figure> <p>In addition to the single purpose sheet metal equipment like a guillotine (plate) <strong>shears,</strong> used to <strong>cut sheet metal</strong>, there are also universally applicable machine tools like presses. If equipped with the right punches, a press can undertake both forming and separating processes. The press brake is used to form sheet metal into equally long components. <strong>Round bending machines are used to produce pipes out of sheet metal</strong>. Similar tasks include profile bending machines for metal bands and profiles. The <strong>profile metal shear</strong> is used to separate these profiles and bands. <strong>Straightening machines</strong> prevent deformations in the sheet metal by using a targeted plastic mould. <strong>One of the most important processes for separating sheet metal is to use shears.</strong> Using this process does not result in cutting off formless pieces, which is what happens when using saws. Thermal cutting machines are used for particularly thick sheet metal or when the cut does not need to be of high quality (e.g. when cutting waste metal). Modern sheet metal processing centres are suitable for both sharing and laser cutting. To treat the surfaces of sheet metal, grinding machines and coating machines are used. Welding machines are used to merge metal sheets together using different types of process. A Metal cutter equipment could be used to cut smaller sheets of metal.</p> <h3>Types of Metal Machines for Sheets</h3> <figure id=\"attachment_8227\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8227\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/smwe-2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Profile bending machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">For creation of curvature: Profile bending machines</figcaption></figure> <p>Sheet metal machinery is a category that covers a number of items of industrial equipment used in <strong>sheet metal forming</strong>.

Additionally, they contain a workpiece storage unit and a rotating table, which allows for processing of the workpiece on all sides.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8821\" style=\"width: 337px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8821\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/mc-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Machining center\" width=\"337\" height=\"224\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Machining centers answer problems with advanced technology</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\">They do not differ from in terms of their basic structure: the frame and main spindle clamp. Machining centers are often categorized as <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/horizontal-machining-center\">horizontal machining centers</a>, <a href=\"//trademachines.com/vertical-machining-center\">vertical machining centers</a>, or combined universal centers</strong>. Machine centers are particularly effective in their production of small and medium sized series, because they can quickly and easily be adjusted to undertake various tasks. The two main types of machining centers are 5 axis machining center and CNC machining center. Automated devices and flexible processing cells or systems can be integrated into machining centers for tool changing.</p>\r\n<h4>Background and Areas of Application for the Different Types of Machines in a Machining Centers</h4>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Machining centers</strong> are the answer for the increasing productivity demands in production technology. The<strong> integrated tool magazine</strong> enables the work piece to be processed on all sides without having to re-clamp it into the machine. The automatic workpiece feed significantly reduces idle time. These two features, along with numerical control, ensure that a largely <strong>automated process</strong> is possible. The capacity of a machining centre increases with the number of tools that can be automatically implemented. An increase in tools reduces the space requirements for chain magazines in relation to revolving magazines. The round shaped revolving or disk magazine usually has about 40 tools; when working with more than 40 tools, it is more common to use a chain magazine.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Magazines are available either as <strong>star or drum shaped designs</strong>, with either a vertical jointing direction or one parallel to the axis in vertical machining centers. The distance between the magazine storage and the spindle, and the magazine’s structure and jointing direction, influence the tool changing time. This is due to the various required movements and the distance the tool needs to travel during a tool change. Even the shape of the tool changer has a significant influence on the time required for tool changing. Double tool changers can simultaneously take up a tool from the main spindle and the magazine, and can switch both in one step. Simple changers require two steps for this tool change. It is also important to note that if there is no intermediary storage space for the tool, the positioning of the magazine on the old and subsequently the new tool has to happen during idle time.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8827\" style=\"width: 200px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8827 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/mc-2-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"tools machining center\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tool magazine with coded tools</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The correct allocation of the tools used on the machine is decided through coding the <strong>work tools</strong> or the location of the <strong>magazine</strong>. If the location is coded, then the tools always have to be laid into the machine in the same order. If the tools are coded, then the machine will look for the right tool by reading the tool’s codes. It is possible to have a more flexible use of the magazine, with shorter tool switching times, through a combination of both encodings and electronic accounting through the controls.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The number of controllable movement axes (<strong>usually there are three translational and up to two rotational axes</strong>) is another important characteristic that determines the capacity of a machine center. The adjustable speed of the spindle, the length of the working and feed routes, and the size and capacity of the work table, are also important characteristics. If the intention is to use the work table of the machining center as a main spindle for turning the workpiece, then the speed and capacity of the rotary table is also an important feature to note.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Machining centers</strong> usually have a cross-bed design, or similar, type of machine bed. They are also commonly available in a travelling column design. The cross-bed design has at least one translational motion axis for the workpiece carrier. With the travelling column design, the workpiece carrier moves along all three main translational axes. The cross-bed has been expanded into a rectangle machine bed to provide surfaces for the tool changer<strong>, tool magazine</strong> and other additional features.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The flexibility of CNC machining centers is pushed even further through their modular structure. The capacity of the machine tool can be fitted to customer requirements. Additionally, the basic set up can be expanded by using components that can be combined with other machines. This allows manufacturers to offer a wider spectrum of machine tools.</p>\r\n<h2>Used Machining Centers for Sale</h2>\r\n<p>Find a suitable <strong>used machining center</strong> can be a tricky job as you need to check certain quality factors such as manufacturer, year of make, model and its drawbacks since the beginning of its production and available machine tools service representatives nearby from the manufacturers.

It is the oldest procedure used in industry since 1908. Cutting with the oxy fuel process is just the opposite from gas welding which is a process of joining metals by application of heat created by gas flame. Gas cutting machines, such as CNC gas cutting machine and automatic gas cutting machine, use acetylene and oxygen to preheat metal to red hot and then use pure oxygen to burn away the preheated metal. Because this is achieved by oxidation, it is only effective on metals like mild steel and low alloy steels that are easily oxidized at this temperature. Gas cutting tools can be used to cut thicknesses from 2/8″ to up to 12″.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Working of a Gas Cutting Machine</strong></h3> <figure id=\"attachment_9863\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9863\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/gas-cutting-torch.jpg\" alt=\"Gas cutting equipment under operation\" width=\"350\" height=\"324\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sheet metal cutting by a Gas cutting torch</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The equipment and accessories for oxy-gas cutting are the same as for oxy-gas welding except that you use a gas cutting torch, accompanied by a gas cutting set, instead of a welding torch. The main difference between the cutting torch and the welding torch is that the cutting torch has an additional tube for high-pressure oxygen, along with a cutting tip or nozzle. The tip is provided with a center hole through which a jet of pure oxygen passes. Mixed oxygen and acetylene pass through holes surrounding the center holes for the preheating flames. The number of orifices for oxyacetylene flames ranges from 2 to 6, depending on the purpose for which the tip is used. The cutting torch is controlled by a trigger or lever operated valve. The cutting torch is furnished with interchangeable tips for cutting steel from less than ¼” to more than 12.0” in thickness. Gas cutting can be done manually or by a machine, called gas cutting machine. The manual cutting is used for general purpose work and for straight line cutting. In machine cutting, the torch is mounted on a rail and both rail and the torch can move simultaneously along two mutually perpendicular axes in the horizontal plane with the help of servo motors. Robotic oxy-fuel cutters provide flexibility to produce almost any shape from large steel plates. There is provision to hold more than one torch so that large number of identical pieces can be cut at the same time.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Applications of Gas Cutting</strong></h3> <ul style=\"text-align: justify\"> <li>Gas cutting would be useful only for those materials which readily get oxidized and the oxides have lower melting points than the metals.

It has become a manufacturing engineering axiom that part reject and rework rates will fall down, if a mass finishing approach can be implemented to meet surface finish requirements. While a surface finishing process does not guarantee that the final finish on a product will be a high-quality finish, it does improve surface properties, upgrade product quality, and enhance the image of the metal finishing process.</p> <h3><strong>Mass Finishing Equipments and its Types</strong></h3> <p>There are five major equipment groups as follows: <strong>rotary barrels, vibratory tubs and round bowl machines, centrifugal barrel with turret mounted drums, centrifugal disk, and spin/spindle finishing.</strong> The first four groups are primarily used with parts immersed within a body of abrasive media and are capable of some independent movement within that mass. At times, fixturing may be used to isolate delicate or critical parts from each other. Part on part contact may also be minimized by using higher media-to-part ratio combinations. Common media-to-part ratios for noncritical parts run anywhere from 1:1 to 1:4 by volume. Parts with a higher need for cushioning and protection may utilize media/part ratios as high as 10:1 to 15:1. In contrast, all spin/spindle finishing processes utilize fixturing of parts, and in most cases movement of the fixture develops much of the action needed to abrade the parts.</p> <h3><strong>Working Principle of Mass Finishing Equipment</strong></h3> <p>The operating principle of the above mentioned mass finishing equipments are:</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9531\" style=\"width: 316px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-9531\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/mfm-1-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"Centrifugal barrel finishing machine\" width=\"316\" height=\"174\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Centrifugal barrel finishing machine in use</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>1. Rotary barrel finishing</strong> <strong>(tumbling)</strong> is carried out in a rotating container. Tumbling is a slide action process whereas the mass (parts and media) slides down a slope created via the container’s rotation. The mass slide occurs when gravity overcomes a portion of the mass (15-20% more or less) sending it gently sliding down the incline. The optimal loading is 60% of the container volume, which provides the longest slide resulting in smoother finishes and faster cycle times.</p> <p><strong>2. Vibratory finishing</strong> is the most popular method where energy is induced via rotating eccentric weights vibrating the container which are transferred from the walls of the machine to the media and hence to the parts in the tub or bowl. Such a process requires vibratory finishing machines.</p> <p><strong>3. The centrifugal barrel system</strong> uses centrifugal force to increase the pressure of the media on the parts being finished.</p> <p><strong>4. The centrifugal disc</strong> is a stationary round outer wall with a high speed rotation bottom independent of the outer containment wall creating a tornadic motion to the mass around the outer wall thereby imparting an increased pressure of the media on the parts and constant change in speed of the mass.</p> <p><strong>5. Spindle finishing</strong> accomplishes surface improvement by fixturing parts on rotating spindles and plowing them through a mass of loose abrasive, utilizing both pressure and abrasive action.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9537\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-9537\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/mfm-3-300x220.jpg\" alt=\"Vibratory finishing machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mass fishing with a Vibratory finishing machine</figcaption></figure> <h3><strong>Applications of Mass Finishing Machines</strong></h3> <p>The major applications of mass finishing machines are:</p> <p><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Cleaning is the primary function of mass finishing, and is the basis for all surface finishing operations. It is a pre-requisite that in order to efficiently debur, surface refine, inhibit, and dry, the part must be clean. Cleaning is simply the removal of unwanted residue from the part, these residues may be present as dust or particulates, cutting or stamping fluid, die lubes, corrosion inhibitors, oxidation or scale.</p> <p><strong>Deburring:</strong> Deburring employs the use of abrasive media to grind away machine lines, belting marks, burrs, sharp edges, slag, and establish radius.</p> <p><strong>Surface refinement</strong>: Surface refinement lowers rough surface finishes to acceptable standards for plating, polishing, anodizing, and painting operations. Generally these finishes are measured by a profilometer and expressed in terms of RA, or the average distance between the peaks and valleys of the parts surface.</p> <p><strong>Inhibition:</strong> Once the part has been cleaned, deburred, and surface refined it must be protected from oxidation and corrosion.</p> <p><strong>Drying:</strong> When the above operations are carried out, the resultant product will be wet. The parts are required to be dried inorder to insure optimum corrosion inhibition.</p> <p>Some of the other auxiliary functions of mass finishing equipments are: Radiusing, Degreasing, Descaling, Pickling and Burnishing. </p> <p></p>"},{"id":"1357_en","content":"<p>Cleaning plants are used to <strong>prepare intermediary or end products</strong>, which will be further processed or sold.</p>\r\n<h2>Different types of Cleaning Equipment</h2>\r\n<p>Commercial Cleaning Equipment is a <strong>intermediary station</strong> used during the industrial production of products. They are particularly important <strong>after cutting processes</strong>, because finished products are usually covered in dust, chippings and cooling lubricant. A clean surface is particularly important for <strong>coating processes</strong>; adhesive dirt or solvents can prevent the coat from being successfully applied. There is always the risk that the customer will find the dirt on the workpiece, if it is not removed during the production process.</p>\r\n<p>The production of industrially processed components always contains a certain degree of contamination. Lubricants are necessary for the diverse technical processes but they will stick to the intermediary and end products until they are<strong> intentionally removed</strong>. The thorough and intent cleaning of a product can reduce the level of contamination of the entire process, depending on the work step. This ensures that contamination, and the loss of quality of the workpiece as a result, is prevented. Milled products have particularly high levels of contamination, even though milling machines are always equipped with <strong>extraction and cleaning systems</strong>. There are always bits of waste material, including chippings and dust located on the finished products, which can have negative consequences on any further processes. In order to reliably remove these pieces of contamination, the industry has a variety of solutions for cleaning intermediary and end products with duct cleaning equipment.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_7589\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7589\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/ce-2-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"pipe cleaning machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cleaning after production process</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<h2>Industrial Cleaning Machines : Structure</h2>\r\n<p>There are a variety of designs for a cleaning system and these are commonly based on the what material needs to be cleaned. With products that are sensitive to humidity, water, solvents and emulsions cannot be used. Therefore, wood products are cleaned using <strong>compressed air and extraction units</strong>. However, these products also usually require <strong>a manual clean</strong>. There are a variety of diverse cleaning agents available for non-absorbent workpieces. Additionally, warm, ultrasonic, mechanical processes and special solutions can be used during the rinsing process. Oiled products can only be cleaned with <strong>solvents containing soap or gasoline</strong>. It is important to know the exact composition of the workpiece surface and the cleaning agents. Veneered surfaces, for example, cannot be cleaned using agents containing gasoline. These solvents are expensive to dispose of, because they are a problem material.</p>\r\n<p>One of the biggest challenges of cleaning plants is to remove contaminated cleaning agents. Nowadays, there are several solutions available: <strong>filter systems</strong> that reduce the amount of cleaning agent required; and preparation processes that can transform solvents to make them useable again. Lastly, cleaning agents containing gasoline can be burned in specially fitted machines and can be used as a heat source.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>rinsing cleaning plants</strong> operate in a similar way to household dishwashers. Small products that are easily scratched are often cleaned in drum sieves. Fragile products like mechanical components are placed into custom-fit baskets so that they do not touch each other and can still be fully rinsed by the cleaning agent. The defined measurements and weight of the baskets means that industrial robots can be used to load these cleaning plants. The cleaning process is integrated into industrial production and commonly runs automatically.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Brushes and textiles</strong> can be used as an additional, mechanical process to erode contaminated particles. These can be used to supplement chemical cleaning processes. Hand cleaning stations can be used for manual cleaning of contaminated workpieces.</p>\r\n<p> <figure id=\"attachment_7593\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7593 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/ce-1-300x142.jpg\" alt=\"cleaning system\" width=\"300\" height=\"142\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cleaning system in metal working industry</figcaption></figure> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Paint stripping systems</strong> are used to clean the mounting hooks on lacquered and power coating lines. These hooks are continually guided through the coating machines, which is why they always retain a thick layer of veneer or plastic powder, up to the point where they can no longer be used. The paint stripping systems are used to remove this layer so that the hooks can be used again. A particularly sharp cleaning material is used for this process, which then needs to be removed, before the hooks can be handled by workers. Therefore, cleaning processes are also commonly required after the initial cleaning process. Sometimes several cleaning stages are required; this also includes the <strong>final drying stage</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The company VIBRO-TEC from Unna has an innovative application for efficiently removing oil and lubricant, without producing even more waste material. Instead of using cleaning agents, the products are <strong>rinsed</strong> with a normal, industrial <strong>cooling lubricant</strong> and then finally cleaned with <strong>ultra fast vibrations</strong>. The cooling lubricant can be used as often as needed and does not get dirty during the cleaning process. This process prevents the otherwise necessary removal costs of contaminated cleaning liquids, without reducing the quality of the cleaning process.</p>\r\n<h2>Working with a Cleaning Plant</h2>\r\n<p><strong> Loading and unloading</strong> the products in a cleaning plant is generally unproblematic. When <strong>operating a cleaning machine</strong> it is necessary to wear protective clothing, including respiratory protection. Depending on the situation, the cleaning process can also be undertaken by industrial robots or integrated <strong>feeding systems</strong>. Continuous cleaning can be used to ensure defined conditions for the products. For a high-end and high quality orientated mass production processes, cleaning the intermediary and end products is a deciding factor.</p>\r\n<h2>Suppliers of cleaning plants</h2>\r\n<p>Manual cleaning plants are available from the companies MICHAEL LANG WERKZEUGMASCHINEN, SNIJSTAAL Fabricage and WÄCHTER. The cleaning plants manufactured by MICHAEL LANG WERKZEUGMASCHINEN are fully encased, which prevents any cleaning agents from coming in contact with a worker’s skin. Cleaning stations used to continually clean series products are available from the companies UNICLEAN, HTK-REINIGUNSANLAGEN, IBW and VIBRO-TEC. The company GOTTSCHILD specialises itself on producing cleaning plants with integrated conveyor belts.

Blasting is used nowadays for various industrial purposes: to clean a surface by removing unwanted rust, scale, paint, etc.; as a surface preparation method for painting, anodizing, welding, or other processes which require a clean surface; to remove burrs, tooling marks, or otherwise finish a crude product; to change metallurgical properties or stress relieve a part by the peening action of multiple impactions; to produce a desired matte or decorative finish; to  remove flashing (excess material) from molded plastic or rubber. It is utilized in several types of industries like foundries, shipyards, steel fabrication plants, special purpose job and machine shops, steel mills, breweries, canneries, rubber manufacturers, painting contractors, plastic manufacturers, welders, wood shops and furniture manufacturers, plating and anodizing shops, automotive industries, aircraft manufacturers, electronic manufacturers, petrochemical companies and many others.</p>\r\n<h2>Blasting Machine and Its Parts</h2>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<p> The basic components of a blasting system are described below:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Media Delivery Systems:&nbsp;</strong>There are three different kinds of media delivery systems by which the blasting media is propelled and delivered at high speed to the part being processed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Air Blasting (Pneumatic) – Air blast delivery systems can be further sub-divided into two types as: Suction which works on the principle of sucking media from a hopper and Pressure systems which uses a pressurized pot which is energized by compressed air. The pressure blasting systems are much more productive when blasting than suction systems and also the acceleration rates of air/media mix are much higher in pressure blasting than suction blasting.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Mechanical Wheel - Wheel blast system also called as airless blasting utilizes a high speed rotation wheel using centrifugal force to propel the media. Wheel blast systems are a less expensive way to blast because of higher media recyclability and automation than air blasting but they pose restrictions on the type of media that can be selected due to the impact on the media by the hard rotating wheel.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Hydro blasting - This type of blasting system uses a pressurized water stream generated by pumps that are capable of pumping an abrasive charged water supply at high rates of speed. Hydro Systems are best suited for conveying very ﬁne abrasives. They are also used in cleaning gunky, greasy parts, and containing toxic materials.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Containment Systems:</strong> Hand cabinets, automated enclosures and blast rooms are the containment systems built to control and contain the blast media and parts within the enclosures. They are capable of handling various size and shapes of parts to be blasted. The enclosure systems use gravity for the blasted media to drop down to a collection area so the media can be conveyed to the reclaim system. Blast systems can have inexpensive or premium containment systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p> <strong>Media Reclaim Systems:</strong> Recoverable medias used in industrial blast systems will run from 5 to 100 times through the blast system. These recoverable medias need to be cleaned, sized and returned to the blast system after being blasted which is accomplished by the media reclaim system. Production rate is consistently maintained by the media reclaim system. Media reclaim systems can be Air Cyclones or Mechanical Systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dust Collection:</strong> All Industrial blast systems utilize dust collectors which remove the ﬁne blasting dust keeping the media clean and operators safe through visibility and breathable air. Normally dust collectors remove 99% of 1 micron or larger material. Filters can be added to remove dust particles down to 1/2 micron. Dust collectors are sized to the cabinet size, media type, and amount of blast nozzles or wheels being used.</p>\r\n<h2>Types of Blasting Equipment</h2>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<p>The five types of abrasive blast cleaning systems commonly used are:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Portable blast cleaning machines</strong> – Portable blast cleaning machines usually require a high volume air supply (in the range of 90 to 100 psi); a container or pressure vessel to contain the abrasive; a metering device to control air-to-abrasive ratio and flow; a flexible hose to deliver the abrasive, and a hand-held nozzle to aim the abrasive onto the work piece. Many portable units also have large hopper-fed storage tanks which enable multiple blasting operations from a single source of supply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong> Hand-operated units in blast cleaning rooms</strong> – These units are almost similar to the portable machines. The principle benefits afforded by blast cleaning rooms are their ability to provide and use a dust control ventilation system, cost savings from recycling the abrasive and containment of dust and debris so that they do not spread over large areas and expose other workers and machinery to injury and damage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong> Hand-operated cabinet type blast cleaning machines</strong> – Cabinet type units generally are used for cleaning small parts that can be handheld or positioned on a rotatable mandrel. In such units the job and the abrasive are confined within a metal cabinet. Direction of the abrasive discharge is manually, semi-automatically or automatically controlled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong> Automatic blast cleaning machines</strong> – These units are larger in dimension and are more heavily constructed than cabinet machines. Most operate on the centrifugal wheel principle and employ timers and automatic shut-off controls to provide the desired amount of abrasive exposure. Work piece can be placed on either a rotating table or an endless revolving belt that tumbles the job to expose all surfaces to the abrasive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wet-blast cleaning machines</strong> – This method can be applied to portable machines provided that abrasive is thoroughly mixed with water forming slurry. Since rusting of metal parts becomes a problem, rust inhibitors are added to the slurry. </p>\r\n<h2>Blasting Media</h2>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<p>Blast media, type, shape, size and hardness affect the process and materials they are capable of blasting. Higher blast pressures increase production but reduce media life. Blasting harder work pieces also reduces media life. Recoverable blasting medias which are used in industrial blasting have two basic shapes; Round (spherical) and Angular. Spherical medias are used for peening and produce smoother surface ﬁnishes. Angular medias chip at a parts surface thereby they are capable of removing paint, rust and scale quicker, with better results than round medias. Angular medias produce a rougher surface ﬁnish and produce superior anchor patterns for paint and coating adhesions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Blasting Machine for Sale and Its Manufacturers</h2>\r\n<p>Trademachines is the only online marketplace to find various types of blasting machines aggregated from various sellers and auction houses in order to make your blasting equipment selection easier and cheaper. Wheelabrator, OMSG, RÖSLER, Turbotechnica, TOSCA, AGTOS, NORDBLAST, ASCO and BUSE are some of the popular brands involved in the manufacturing of various kinds of blasting systems.</p>\r\n"},{"id":"1353_en","content":"<p><strong>Galvanizing lines</strong> process for copper, nickel, brass, tin, and zinc was adapted for commercial purposes. Many of these coated materials were utilized for particular manufacturing and engineering applications. Electroplating is an electro deposition process for producing a dense, uniform, and adherent coating usually of metal or alloys, upon a surface by the process of electrolysis. It is the method of using an electric current to deposit a thin layer of metal over another from a solution containing a dissolved salt of the selected metal. The history of galvanizing precious metal onto common metals can be traced back to around 1800. In the beginning, gold and silver were the most sought metals to be electroplated on other surfaces for obvious reasons such as its value and appearance. There were two main methods commonly employed for depositing gold on other metals. Later on other types of non-decorative metal plating were developed.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8065\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8065 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/gm-3-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"galvanizing line\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Galvanizing steel in a automated processing line</figcaption></figure> <h3><strong>Why Galvanizing?</strong></h3> <p>The purpose of galvanizing process is to produce a qualified coating with the desirable attributes. The major reason behind galvanizing materials than manufacturing the desired material as a whole is the high amount of costs involved in the latter. When just a coating of the desired material on another surface is sufficient enough to serve the purpose like corrosion or wear resistance, it is <strong>wiser to go for galvanizing rather than directly manufacturing </strong> the material. Some of the purposes for which articles are electroplated are:</p> <ul> <li>To modify their <strong>appearance</strong></li> <li>To <strong>protect</strong> the base metal against corrosion, wear etc.</li> <li>To induce special <strong>surface properties </strong> into the base metal</li> <li>To improve the <strong>engineering or mechanical properties </strong>such as hardness, strength, toughness etc.</li> </ul> <p>Electroplated materials are generally used for a specific property or function, although there may be a few overlapping for e. g., a material may be electroplated for making it more decorative as well as for corrosion resistance. Almost all of the galvanizing coatings would come under any of the following six categories: Sacrificial coating, Decorative protective coating, Engineering coating, Minor metal coating, Unusual metal coating, Alloy coating and Multi layered coating.</p> <h3><strong>Galvanizing Line</strong></h3> <figure id=\"attachment_8058\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8058\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/gm-2-300x162.jpg\" alt=\"galvanize line\" width=\"300\" height=\"162\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Galvanizing nickel barrels with electroplating</figcaption></figure> <p>The parts of a galvanizing machine are described below:</p> <ul> <li>The external circuit which consists of a source of direct current (DC), for completing the electron flow externally.</li> <li>Negatively charged electrode or cathode is the metal to be coated (work piece).</li> <li>Positively charged electrodes or anodes are of two types: sacrificial or inert electrodes. Sacrificial anodes are made of the metal to be deposited. Permanent anodes simply complete the electrical circuit, but cannot provide a source of fresh metal to replace what has been removed from the solution by deposition at the cathode. Carbon and Platinum are the commonly used inert anodes.</li> <li>Electrolytic solution also called as the bath is the electrical conductor in which current is carried by ions rather than by free electrons as in a metal. Electrolyte completes an electric circuit between two electrodes internally.</li> <li>Tank which houses the electrodes and the solution.</li> </ul> <p>Upon the application of electric current, electrolytic decomposition takes place and the metallic ions of the salt in the electrolyte carry a positive charge and are thus attracted to the cathode. When they reach the negatively charged work piece, it provides electrons to reduce those positively charged ions to metallic form and then the metal atoms will be deposited onto the surface of the cathodic work piece.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8071\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8071\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/gm-4-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"rack plating\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rack plating in a company</figcaption></figure> <h3><strong>Types of Electroplating Processes</strong></h3> <p>There are four different types of galvanizing processes commonly adopted in the industries which are:</p> <ul> <li>Mass Plating – For coating small work pieces in large quantities but it is not used for delicate work pieces.</li> <li>Rack Plating – It is done when the work pieces cannot be mass plated because of size, shape restrictions. It involves mounting of jobs on racks for pre-treatment and subsequent coating.</li> <li>Continuous Plating – The work pieces to be plated move continuously passing either one row or between two rows of anodes. It is usually performed when the jobs are simple and uniform in geometry.</li> <li>In-line Plating – It involves integration of plating and finishing process. Less energy consumption and reduction in waste discharge are some of its advantages.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Applications of Galvanizing Lines</strong></h3> <p>The major advantage of galvanising process is <strong>cost effectiveness </strong> and <strong>any electrically conductive surface can be electroplated</strong>. Also special techniques such as coating with metallic loaded paints or silver reduced spray, were also increasingly developed to make nonconductive surfaces such as plastic electrically conductive for galvanizing. Electroplating is carried out on certain materials to make them electrically conductive, highly resistant to larger temperatures and sometimes to make them friction resistant. Galvanising services are widely used in many industries such as automobile, ship building, aerospace, machinery, electronics, jewelry, defense and toy making industries. Copper plating is used to prevent case hardening of steels. Silver plating is used in tableware and electrical contacts while gold plating is carried out extensively in jewelries and watches.</p> <p></p> <h2>Galvanizing Line Manufacturers</h2> <p>LINHOFF, Technic Inc. - Cranston, RI, SCHMIDT Galvanotechnik GmBH, RIMMLER GmBH, DECKER, AIRCO, DEWE are few of the manufacturers of galvanizing machines in the world. </p>"},{"id":"1359_en","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Metal Presses - Types &amp; Uses</h2> <p><figure id=\"attachment_7632\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7632 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/pr-2-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Press in workshop \" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Presses process metal sheets without separating any materials</figcaption></figure></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Presses are a specific form of machine tool that uses the application of pressure to alter the shape of a workpiece in industrial manufacturing processes.

A small grinding wheel performs the necessary grinding with its peripheral surface.<br /> <figure id=\"attachment_9915\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9915\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/internal-grinding-machine.jpg\" alt=\"OVERBECK 400 IR Internal Grinder\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Outer view of Chucking type Internal Grinding Machine</figcaption></figure> </li> <li><strong>Planetary internal grinder</strong> – When the work piece is of irregular shape and cannot be rotated conveniently, the planetary internal grinder is opted for. In this machine the work piece does not rotate. Instead, the grinding wheel orbits the axis of the hole in the work piece.</li> <li><strong>Centreless internal grinder</strong> – An internal centerless grinding machine is used for grinding cylindrical and tapered holes in cylindrical parts like cylindrical liners, various bushings etc. The work piece is rotated between supporting roll, pressure roll and regulating wheel and is ground by the grinding wheel. </li> </ul> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Motion in Internal Grinding Machine</strong></h3> <figure id=\"attachment_9916\" style=\"width: 350px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9916\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/internal-grinder.jpg\" alt=\"Inside view of OVERBECK 400 IR Internal Grinder\" width=\"350\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grinding wheel arrangement in OVERBECK 400 IR Internal Grinder</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The principle elements of a used internal grinding machine are the workhead, which holds the work piece to be ground with its own drive; and the wheelhead, which is the internal grinding spindle. The most popular internal grinder is similar in operation to a boring operation in a lathe. The work piece is held by a work holding device, usually a chuck or collet, and revolved by a motorized headstock. A separate motor head in the same direction as the work piece revolves the grinding wheel. It can be fed in and out of the work and also adjusted for depth of cut. In addition to the rotary motions of work and wheel, an internal grinder has a traverse movement to bring the wheel to and from the work zone, and a reciprocating spindle movement for both the wheel's approach to the work surface and for the feed movement of the wheel during grinding. </p>"},{"id":"1382_en","content":""},{"id":"1385_en","content":"<h2>Bench grinder – a standard machine in all operational facilities</h2><p>A bench grinder consists of a <strong>base frame made out of cast steel, a covered electric motor, one or two grinding discs with a protective device, and a support plate. </strong>The engine is mounted onto the base frame and drives the central shaft. With smaller bench grinders, the grinding disc is directly attached to the shaft. Bigger bench grinders have a belt drive. The support plate, upon which the workpiece is placed, acts as a guide and is located in front of the grinding disc. The grinding disc is either located on a stable worktable or screwed onto a separate column. It is screwed into the floor, which means that the machine has a very stable stance. </p><h2>Increase the efficiency: double wheeled bench grinders</h2><p>Double wheeled bench grinders have two wheels that are powered simultaneously and connected by a rigid shaft. This provides several <strong>advantages</strong>. First of all, the <strong>installation</strong> of the grinding disc is left to the operator. In general, <strong>course and fine grinding discs</strong> can be installed onto one double wheeled bench grinder. <strong>Workpieces that are ground can be prepared and then subsequently processed.</strong> Turning on the bench grinder uses up the most amount of energy. Once it has been set into rotation, a large amount of the energy required to turn the wheels comes from its own momentum. The braking effect of grinding on one of the rotating grinding wheels is offset on a double wheeled bench grinder by the rotational energy of the two grinding wheels. Therefore, they are<strong> particularly energy efficient. </strong></p><h2>The types of double wheeled bench grinders</h2><dl>  <dt> </dt><dd>  A double wheeled bench grinder from Flott</dd></dl><p> Double wheeled bench grinders are machines used for manually grinding components. They are usually (there is one exception) only <strong>suited for large products and work that is not technically demanding</strong>. The most common uses for a bench grinder include regrinding chisels, deburring injection-moulded and die cast products, milling flame-cut or cut components, and cleaning tools. Grinders can be required to clean tools if they are, for example, covered with adhesive resin or varnish. <strong>D</strong><strong>ouble wheeled bench grinders can also be equipped with polishing discs or brushes, instead of grinding discs. </strong>The size of these machines ranges from small table-top bench grinders, with hand-sized grinding discs, up to large double bench grinders, whose grinding discs are up to a meter in diameter. </p><p><strong>Bench grinders </strong>used for <strong>precious stones </strong>are the <strong>exception </strong>in terms of precision. These operate with a much higher rotation speed have an automatic water supply. Grinding precious stones requires a lot of experience and a good eye. With the right skills, the operator of a bench grinder for precious stones can work to a level of precision within a fraction of a millimetre.</p><h2>Working with a double wheeled bench grinder</h2><p>In order to properly handle a bench grinder, new workers should receive a safety briefing from an operational expert. <strong>It is very important to note, that one should not wear gloves when working with a bench grinder. </strong>The problem is that the gloves can get caught by the rotating discs and the momentum would pull the worker's hands towards the disc. This could lead to bad injuries. Close-fitting clothing is required, because loose t-shirts or jumpers could also come into contact with the grinding disc and cause the same problem. The same goes for hair; long-haired workers can only work with a bench grinder when wearing a hair net or another form of protection. </p><p>The course side of the grinding disc quickly removes a lot of material from a workpiece. Workers with little experience should practice grinding waste material before processing high-end products and tools. The material that is taken off is mainly caught by the cover. However, there is a still a lot of waste material that flies around uncontrollably. Therefore, it is important to wear <strong>eye protection </strong>(this is the <strong>minimum</strong> <strong>safety equipment required</strong>). Depending on the type of workpiece, sometimes it is <strong>also important to wear a mouth guard. </strong>Grinding dust from galvanised sheet metal is very toxic. Due to the health risks, it is important to undertake the necessary safety precautions when working with a bench grinder. </p><p>Before and during the work, the technical conditions should always be inspected and monitored. The frame, the engine's cover, and the protective cover for the grinding disc could have rips, holes or defects. The electric cable and switches on the control board all have to be undamaged. Before starting the bench grinder, it is recommended to check the state of the entire machine and that the grinding discs are fixed into place.</p><p>The bench grinder should run steadily and reliably. During operation, the rotation speed should not oscillate. <strong>A damaged engine can be recognised by the development of sparks or turbulent operation. If this occurs, the bench grinder should be immediately switched off and unplugged.</strong> </p><p>Noisy bench grinders are often the <strong>due to the fact that they are unbalanced. </strong>This is commonly due to the material only being ground on one side. <strong>This cannot be avoided on bench grinders </strong>and occurs sooner or later on all grinding discs. The roundness of the grinding disc can be fixed using a straightening tool. This should not be neglected because an imbalance in the grinding disc can quickly lead to damages in the bearings. To repair these would be much more complicated than straightening the grinding disc. </p><p>Working with a bench grinder is always <strong>very loud.</strong> Therefore, <strong>ear protection</strong> is useful and is usually a <strong>requirement. </strong></p><h2>Cleaning a bench grinder</h2><p>Because of the abrasion that occurs between the grinding disc and the workpiece, bench grinders produce a lot of grinding dust. Therefore, it is necessary to <strong>thoroughly clean </strong>the workspace <strong>after every work step. </strong>Compressed air guns are not suited for this task, because they distribute the debris and fine dust all over the place. Metal dust is particularly dangerous because it is conductive, which means that it can cause damage to electric components or cause short circuits. <strong>The ideal cleaning process for bench grinders is just rinsing and vacuuming</strong>. Sweeping and manually wiping the grinder with a damp cloth is much better than cleaning the bench grinder with compressed air. </p><h2>Suppliers of bench grinders</h2><p>Normal table-top bench grinders are very cheap and available in all building supply stores. It is only useful to buy these machines used, when they are from a well-known brand. The biggest tool manufacturers all have bench grinders and double wheeled bench grinders in their product range. This includes the companies AEG, METABO, FEIN, BOSCH and MAKITA. It is possible to order individual components from these companies. Therefore, if there are small defects, it is easy to repair the machines. </p><p>Large bench grinders are available from the companies REMA, GREIF, GISAG, HIMMELWERK and LES.</p>"},{"id":"1386_en","content":""},{"id":"1381_en","content":"<p><strong>Centerless grinding process</strong> is similar to the other centered grinding operations except that there is no spindle involved in the machining process. This allows high through-put since parts can be quickly inserted and removed from the process. The work piece is not mechanically constrained in <strong>centreless grinding</strong> as the work piece rotates between a high speed grinding wheel and a slower speed regulating drive wheel. The work is supported from below by a fixed work-rest blade and also on its outer diameter by the regulating wheel. As the work piece is supported only by the regulating wheel and the blade, centerless grinding is a more rigid system which provides the advantage of performing <strong>more accurate and efficient grinding when compared to grinding between centers</strong>.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8731\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8731 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/cgm-300x96.jpg\" alt=\"Centerless Grinder\" width=\"300\" height=\"96\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grinding without a spindle allows fast production output</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>Infeed &amp; Thru-feed Centerless Grinding</strong></h2> <p>The two basic modes of centerless grinding are <strong>\"thru-feed\" and \"in-feed\" or \"plunge\" mode</strong>. In the thru-feed mode, the work proceeds in the axial direction through the slowly narrowing gap between the grinding wheel and the regulating wheel. Work is advanced by the axial force exerted on it by the rotating surface of the regulating wheel. <strong>This is a highly productive form of grinding in that a number of work pieces can be ground simultaneously and in a continuous stream.</strong> The infeed mode is used for work with projecting heads that would prohibit thru-feeding, the work is placed on the work-rest blade while one wheel is retracted and fed to an end stop. The wheel is then brought back, reducing the gap between the wheels, grinding the work. Setting up for infeed grinding is the less complicated of the two methods but for continuous, production type centerless grinding, the thrufeed method is the most effective as often a single pass is sufficient enough to finish the operation.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Application of Centerless Grinding Machines</strong></h2> <p>A centerless grinding machine, or centerless grinder, can be found in many traditional factories which involve high volume production runs. Centerless grinders have been successfully applied to manufacture a variety of parts ranging from hypodermic needles to bowling balls.

Abrasive operations are performed to achieve a surface finish, which cannot be achieved by conventional machining processes. Through the cylindrical grinding process, and by using a <strong>cylindrical grinding machine</strong>, the external or internal cylindrical surface of a work piece are ground. In external cylindrical grinding machine, the work piece rotates and reciprocates along its axis, although for large and long work parts the grinding wheel reciprocates. In internal cylindrical grinding machine, a small wheel grinds the inside diameter of the part. <strong>The work piece is held in a rotating chuck in the headstock and the wheel rotates at very high rotational speed</strong>. In this cylindrical grinding operation, the work piece rotates and the grinding wheel reciprocates.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Classification of Cylindrical Grinders</strong></h3>\r\n<p>There are<strong> three different types</strong> of cylindrical grinder as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <figure id=\"attachment_9127\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9127 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/cgm-2-300x217.jpg\" alt=\"Universal cylindrical grinder\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Universal cylindrical surface grinder are one type of cylindrical grinders</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p> <strong>Plain centre type cylindrical grinder</strong> - The machine is similar to a centre lathe in many respects.

The briquettes most commonly used are: <strong>charcoal briquettes and biomass briquettes.</strong> The machines used for producing briquettes are <strong>briquetting machines</strong>. The most significant motive of wood briquetting machine is to create best from the waste. Subsequently, after setting up such wood briquette machine one can convert wastage into usable energy which can help them to earn. Briquettes are everyday less costly than coal and briquetting plant usually do not release any sulphur. Many briquetting plants are established because of its inherent immense advantages and benefits. With the latest technological improvement, the briquette making machine came into existence which changed the definition to treat industrial waste in its entirety. With the pressure on the industrial unit on the rise for using measures that are eco-friendly and contribute to go for a <strong>green revolution</strong>, a hike has been observed in the demand for such machines.</p> <h2>Biomass Briquetting Machines</h2> <p>The manufacturers of bio fuel briquetting machine help in converting industrial wastes into usable forms of fuel. Briquettes plant transforms ordinary industrial and forestry waste into dense briquettes, with a <strong>volume reduction to save storage space</strong>, reduce loss during transportation and storage, makes biomass waste more easy and effective. Biomass briquette machines are machines which are capable to grind any type of agro forestry waste and industrial waste and convert them into useful biomass briquettes. These machines have high production capacity which depends upon raw material size and quality and they require less electricity to produce bio fuels. If raw material contains moisture so it is necessary to dry it. The most amazing and unique feature about this machine is that <strong>it does not require any binder in the whole biomass briquetting process</strong>. So it is a completely eco pleasant technology. Briquettes of uniform length are produced from a briquettes machine with the help of an automatic control system.</p> <p></p> <h3 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Advantages of Briquetting Machines </strong></h3> <p>A few <strong>advantages</strong> of briquette machines which make them more sought for are:</p> <ul> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Reliable and long-lasting</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Consistent quality of the briquettes produced</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Extremely low operating and preservation costs</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Very low ratio of energy consumed to produced</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Recycling of Agriculture waste and Industrial waste</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Production of different forms of biomass briquettes</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Rugged construction</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Greatest volume reduction of raw materials</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Low wear</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Low electrical load relative to briquette capacity</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Reduced costs of handling and shipping</li> </ul> <p>On TradeMachines, you are able to find a large collection of used briquetting machines for sale from the best briquetting machine manufacturers.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13407\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/wood-briquette-machine.jpg\" alt=\"wood briquette machine\" width=\"1115\" height=\"614\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"> </p>"},{"id":"1418_en","content":"<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Industrial Heater and its use</span></h2>\r\n<p><b>Heaters</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are designed for a number of uses.

When combustion occurs inside the engine, harmful gases are given off as by-products. These gases often leave the engine containing dangerous substances that can't be released unaltered into the surrounding air. For this reason, the gases must travel through an extraction system that removes most of the hazardous substances first. The system also quiets a large amount of the noise from the running engine.</p> <h2><strong>Working with an Extraction System</strong></h2> <p><figure id=\"attachment_9188\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-9188\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/es2-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"steam exhausting machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Exhaust steam in a hot rolling mill</figcaption></figure></p> <p>The primary components of an exhaust system <strong>include the exhaust manifold, pipes, catalytic converter, muffler and tailpipe.</strong> These components work together to collect and transport the exhaust gases. If something goes wrong with the system, the gases may not flow correctly. This can cause problems with an engine's performance if the gases become trapped and unable to move through the system. Gases leaking out before the dangerous substances are removed may create a possible safety hazard, especially if they enter the passenger compartment of the vehicle.</p> <p><figure id=\"attachment_25511\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25511\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/Extraction-Systems-plant-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"Extraction Systems plant\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Extraction Systems plant</figcaption></figure></p> <p><strong>The exhaust manifold is the first part of an extraction system that gases travel through.</strong> The exhaust manifold gathers the gases from the different cylinders of the engine in a single location and combines them in one pipe before they travel on. The gases continue to move through the pipes toward the rear of the vehicle, pushed through continuously as more enter the system.</p> <p>The hazardous gases are cleaned in the catalytic converter on the way through the exhaust system. <strong>The catalytic converter removes harmful substances from the gases</strong>, thus making the remaining gas into a relatively harmless mixture that won't harm people or the environment. The next stop is the muffler, which quiets much of the noise from the running engine using sound deadening materials.

A base frame and cover houses all of its components. It has an engine for an integrated conveyor belt, upon which the furniture panels are placed. The panel thickness is set using an adjustable bridge. <strong>The conveyor belt and rollers, which are positioned above the conveyor belt, are used to press the veneer of PVC material onto the wood panel.</strong> Modern machines use belt bands instead of rollers. A veneer press machine or edge banding machine has at least several electrical engines that are synchronised to each other.</p>\r\n<h2>Different Uses for the Edge Banding Machine</h2>\r\n<p>Edge banding machines are available either as single sided or double sided versions. Single sided machines can only coat one side of the chipboard panel. In order to ensure efficient production, <strong>double sided machines have double aggregates, which mean that two edges can be glued and pressed simultaneously</strong>. Hot glue is used as the agent for all veneers. This is particularly sensitive towards humidity. Hot glue is applied to the veneer and/or the panel’s surface at the gluing station. Roller systems are implemented for this purpose. The edge band is then transferred from one roller onto the panel’s edge immediately, and then pressed there long enough so the glue cools and hardens. First of all, the edge band is cut by guillotine shears and then trimmed with a precise trimming device. <strong>Modern edgebander machines combine the gluing process with profiling the edges. </strong>This is and impotent aspect when looking for an edge banding machine for sale.  </p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8575\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8575\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/ebm-3-300x141.jpg\" alt=\"edgebanding machine glue\" width=\"300\" height=\"141\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gluing process inside the edge banding machine</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>A flush and form milling machine is used to create the desired planes, inclinations and radii on the profile of the wood panel’s edges. Because the<strong> milling process</strong> always ends up resulting in a large amount of dust and chippings (especially with wood workpieces), a powerful extraction unit is important for flush and form milling. Veneer and PVC bands require very flat surfaces, similar to lacquered surfaces. Irregularities cannot be concealed by adding small adhesive layers. Therefore, thin coatings (e.g. for plastic edges) are usually processed using a <strong>profile scraper</strong> after milling. The machines used for this undertake small steps to scrape off the layer of the milled profile, resulting in a completely smooth surface. After gluing the edge, a flat scraper is used to remove all the remaining glue and edges.</p>\r\n<p>Other optional available aggregates for an edge banding machine are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A <strong>polishing unit</strong>, which is a felt wheel used to polish plastic edges so that they become glossy.</li>\r\n<li>A <strong>sanding unit</strong>, which later sands down the edges.</li>\r\n<li>A <strong>spray system</strong>, which prevents the glue and surfaces of getting stuck to one another in unintended places.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Edge banding machines are available in a range from easily adjustable table machines up to machines for large assembly lines. The larger the machine, the more automatic functions it has. For small table machines, the panels must be laid in manually and supported during the gluing process. The small edge banding machines are most suited for individual products, like custom-made furniture, kitchens or boat equipment. They are not suitable for mass production. <strong>Small edge banding machines</strong> can only host a limited number of extra components. Small machines are cheaper and more flexible, but need to be supported by other machines to undertake special customer requirements. The bigger an edge banding machine is, the more accessories and equipment it can have. <strong>Large machines are usually integrated into assembly lines and are suited for processing large numbers of products.</strong></p>\r\n<h2>Possible Additions to an Edge Banding Machine</h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8574\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8574 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/ebm-2-300x130.jpg\" alt=\"chopsaw in edgebander\" width=\"300\" height=\"130\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trimming the edge band with a chop saw</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>A router is a very useful addition to small and medium-sized edge banding machines. This allows panels to be profiled, and for companies to provide custom-made products. These require a powerful extraction system to get rid of dirt like dust and chippings, and keep them away from the gluing process.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Automatic drilling stations, turning stations and automatic packaging machines are useful for continuous mass production.</strong> Large edge banding machines can only undertake their full potential when placed in an integrated production network. It doesn’t make any sense for production processes, when the machines are not working to their full potential due to another machine that is old or the wrong size slowing down the process. Therefore, investing in a high-end and fully equipped edge banding machine has to be well thought through. The high capacity machines can only contribute to the high output of finished products when all other processing points also work to the same speed.</p>\r\n<h2>Working with an Edge Banding Machine</h2>\r\n<p>How to operate small and medium sized edge banding machines can be learned quickly, but it requires a lot of practice. Even assistants without qualified training as a carpenter or furniture designer would not have a problem operating one of these machines. Operating these machines is generally not dangerous. After a thorough briefing and some practice runs, <strong>even untrained workers could achieve good results using this machine</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Complete machines do not need very many external operators. The work required by operators is restricted to dealing with jams, cleaning and monitoring the production process. The basic setting adjustments and important job of unblocking jams can also be undertaken by unskilled workers. Production machines always require a qualified machine fitter to set up the machines and to take over if there is a more serious jam.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Buying an Edge Banding Machine</h2>\r\n<p>Edge banding machines are special machines and there are only a few companies that manufacture them. These manufacturers usually have decades of experience and have good customer service and a spare parts service. Edge banding machines are very s<strong>ensitive against unsuitable working conditions</strong> like changes in temperature, dirt or humidity. They require a lot of maintenance and this should always be well documented. Negligence when undertaking maintenance, especially around the gluing station, can lead to lots of follow-up costs in the future. A thorough inspection by the service provider of a used machine on site should be undertaken before buying a used machine.</p>\r\n<h2>Suppliers of Used Edgebanders for Sale</h2>\r\n<p>One of the biggest companies with the most experience is the woodworking machines specialist, HOMAG.

The surface planer is a type of milling machine, which removes the material via a rotating knife. Planers typically smooth the wood to make it ready for installation, but they can also help correct any thickness issues. PANHANS 336 surface planner is one model available. It helps with planing trim, and other long boards by giving you a table to work at comfortably. Another option is the SCM F4L model, which offers an industrial machine for planing the surface of wood.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Development of Surface Planing Machines </strong></h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The first surface planer was made in 1914. Up to this time, there were only hand-operated planers, which required a lot of strength and time. The developed machines saved time and made the work easier, so that more material could be processed in a shorter period of time. The planers available today are similar to the old designs, but those used to be powered with steam engines rather than electrically. The size and weight of the machines are continually being reduced, while more safety features are being added.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Surface Planing Process</strong></h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The machine mainly consists of a <strong><strong>support table</strong></strong>, one more or more <strong><strong>auxiliary stops</strong></strong>, a<strong><strong> cutter block </strong></strong>with a <strong><strong>cutting knife </strong></strong>and an <strong><strong>extraction system</strong></strong>. The support table is used as the <strong><strong>feed-in and output table.</strong></strong> The workpiece is placed on the support table and guided along the cutter block, which is located in the middle. This part of the table is narrower than the removed component, because the wood will be pushed down by the auxiliary stop, and after the cutting knife has processed it, the workpiece will be flatter. In order to make sure that the wood on the support table doesn't hang down and remains straight, it is important that the table has a <strong>height difference. </strong>This height difference is determined by the size of material to be removed, and can be adjusted on the machine using a hand-wheel or switch.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_10147\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-10147 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/surface-planer-bed-300x194.jpg\" alt=\"STRICKLER Surface Planer Support Table\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Support Table of a Surface Planer</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">On planers, the projection of the knife shaft over the surrounding cutter block is not allowed to be more than 1.1 mm. In order to ensure that the material doesn't slip during this process, the wood is pushed onto the table via the auxiliary stop on the machine. The workpiece is pushed towards the cutterblock either by hand, or the machine, at a speed of about 5-30 m/min. The cutting knife is located on the cutter block, which rotates and removes the uneven layer of wood workpiece, and moves the chips towards the extraction system. In order to protect against flying chips, or accidentally gripping the cutting knife, it is important to ensure that there is a <strong><strong>cover</strong></strong>. There are three different types of protective covers: clapper guard (attached by hinges); swing guard (swings to the side if there is a risk); and overhead guard (this most modern variation and permanently covers the cutterblock). The planed wood is then delivered over the support table. Normally, an orthogonally facing surface is processed along with another surface that is perpendicular to it, so that both surfaces are at a right angle to one another and run in a straight direction along both stops. After the wood has been planed several times, it can be further processed using a thicknesser.</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Advantage of Surface Planers</strong></h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">These machines have a lot of advantages over conventional surface planers. For example, working with a machine is much easier. In the past, trainees used to have to learn planing by hand and memorise the movements. This, combined with experience, was the only way to ensure good results. Nowadays, workers only require a simple safety briefing and a <strong>short training</strong> of the process. After that, the work steps are all undertaken in the same way. Machines enable <strong><strong>exact work</strong></strong>, which means that a planed surface has a uniform strength and delivers the same quality. Work accidents with a surface planer can be prevented using the various safety features (emergency stop, cover, cut-off relay). These advantages mean that this is a machine that industry could not do without. The price of the hand-held planer and the surface planing machine cannot be compared. Used surface planing machines cost much less than new ones, and they are able to do the same work. All machines are sold at auction only after they are tested for working condition.</p> <p></p> <h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Used Surface Planers for Sale</h2> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Buying a <strong>used surface planer for sale</strong> is the best way to save money whilst you get the best machine that suits your woodworking process.

Where cabinet makers and window builders had to handle screw clamps with difficulty,  presses can now be used instead. The requirements of permanently monitoring the angles, and the uncertainties in the contact points, are not applicable when using a frame press. The space requirement for a press is significantly bigger than that needed for screw clamps. These presses are particularly suited for individual workpieces and small scale series of high-end furniture pieces (i.e. those that are delivered as finished pieces, rather than those that need to be assembled by the customers). They are therefore a <strong>standard tool</strong> for every furniture and window workshop.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11342\" style=\"width: 202px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11342\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/frame-press-202x300.jpg\" alt=\"old h-frame press\" width=\"202\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Used frame press in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <h4>The structure of a frame press</h4> <p>A frame press is most commonly made out of a <strong>vertical</strong> standing frame with <strong>robust</strong> and <strong>torsion resistant square steel</strong>. There is a supplier, which operates with <strong>aluminium profiles that can be screwed</strong>. These are not comparable to their welded alternatives in terms of the precision of angles and robustness. Adjustable stops are usually attached to the welded frames. The <strong>pressing devices</strong> are attached opposite the stops. The workpiece is laid into the press and then pushed towards the pressing mechanism using the adjustable stops. These produce the necessary pressure required to force the components together and glue the workpiece. The pressing mechanism can either be operated using a lever, a spindle and screw mechanism, hydraulically ( with <strong>c hydraulic frame press</strong> )or electrically. Frame presses are always set up so that several workpieces can be glued simultaneously. The working depth of the stops and the press mechanisms is enough to be able to process several smaller workpieces just after one another. This is very advantageous when gluing together drawers. The gluing process and the associated dwell time in the machine can efficiently be used for follow-up work. The nailing in of a cupboard’s rear wall can be undertaken when the frame is still in the press. Another advantage of the frame press is its ability to bend wood panels in a controlled manner. Radii and curves can be precisely produced using these machines. It ensures <strong>creative possibilities</strong> if operated by an experienced worker.</p> <h4>Types of frame presses</h4> <p>Even though they all look very similar, frame presses differ greatly in terms of their functionality and capacities. Simple and cheap presses are screwed onto a specific point on the floor or wall of a workshop. <strong>Mechanical pressing devices</strong> are highly capable, but they are not as easy to operate. Hydraulically operated pressing mechanisms are more expensive, but they can also apply more pressure (e.g. two tonnes). High-end types are available with a carriage to be able to move workpieces when required. This prevents fragile intermediary products from having to be transported over long distances. Despite the fact that these machines are generally used for individual production, the market also provides high-end machines for mass production of furniture and windows. Normally, the gluing and pressing of series components made out of complete wooden frames is usually undertaken on angular systems. These require further logistical requirements during operation. An automatic frame press can be used as a useful intermediary step between individual production and mass production. The components of an automatic frame press are much better than a simple frame press: in addition to <strong>hydraulic vertical and horizontal pressure cylinders, locking cylinders and servo axes</strong>, there are optional <strong>medium pressure bars, a lateral pressure device and a triangle pressing device</strong>. High-end presses contain a wireless hand panel and an electronic individual control system, so that these machines can be operated by a single worker. The range of manufacturing capabilities of high-end presses is extensive due to features such as automatic loading and unloading, automatic pressing and automatic nailing of floor and rear walls.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_11354\" style=\"width: 344px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-11354\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/c-frame-press1-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"c frame hydraulic press at work\" width=\"344\" height=\"189\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">C frame hydraulic press processing a frame of wood</figcaption></figure> <h5>Types of Frame Presses</h5> <ul> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">A frame press</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">C Frame Press</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">H Frame Press</li> </ul> <h4>Working with a frame press</h4> <p>Frame presses facilitate carpentry processes in that they make the <strong>monitoring</strong> of angles, dimensions and pressures superfluous. However, they cannot be used by laymen. Someone who operates a frame press always has to know what they are doing. Therefore, undertaking training in cabinet making is a useful requirement for working with these machines. If unskilled workers are to be employed, basic briefing (particularly about the functions and uses of the individual components of a frame press) is absolutely necessary. If operated unprofessionally, the large forces that can be applied with a frame press can quickly and permanently damage the workpiece.</p> <h2>Where to buy a frame press ?</h2> <p>Frame press needs to be able to absorb large levels of force. A tensional force of several tonnes means that these machines are very robust. This is particularly the case for quality products from Germany. Because they are commonly available, both as simple mechanical devices and as fully automatic machines, they are often associated with the growth of a company. This means that there is a large supply of high-end, used machines on the market. However, one needs to take care when buying a machine. Unprofessional operation or tipping over, can distort the machine’s frame. Presses with damaged frames can usually not be repaired and should be discarded. Monitoring the <strong>angularity</strong> of the frame is the minimum level of inspection that should be undertaken before buying a used machine. Frame presses are very bulky, but because they significantly increase the ease of furniture construction, they are very popular in simple facilities and for DIY enthusiasts. However, this does not significantly reduce their availability.</p> <h2>Suppliers of Frame Presses</h2> <p>On the used market, the company MAWEG has one of the largest offers of simple and high-end frame presses. Technically simple and very high-end machines are available from the company BARTH. This company’s machines can be continually <strong>expanded</strong>. Therefore, they provide numerous additional components for a frame press that can be bought upon demand. SARMA’s frame presses can be completely disassembled. They have a lot of entry-level models that can always be repaired. These are inferior to those with a <strong>welded base frame</strong>, in terms of their capacity for contact pressure. Particularly easy to use and completely equipped presses are available from S+S MASCHINENBAU. These machines can be used for automatic production for series. High capacity presses for mass production are available from HESS.</p> <p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-11374\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/a-frame-press.jpg\" alt=\"a frame press in workshop\" width=\"810\" height=\"445\" /></p>"},{"id":"1477_en","content":"<p><strong style=\"background-color: initial\">Used sheathing lines </strong> are a type of large machine technology that helps coat different materials such as wood or metal using sheeting lines machines.</p> <h2><strong>Popular Manufacturers and Models </strong></h2> <p>Several manufacturers provide different sheeting lines machines for surface treatments.

The workpeice is placed on the work table, which is generally adjustable both lengthwise and along its width. The sanding paper, which runs over rollers, is pushed onto the material using a sanding shoe. The surface quality is determined through the choice and texture of the sanding material, and the <strong>speed of the sanding belt</strong>. The pressure of the sanding shoe is adjusted via a lever and plays an important roll in the surface quality of the end product. The other possibility is to press down the sanding belt using a pneumatically-controlled sanding shoe. This ensures a constant pressure and is best used for continuous high surface quality. <strong>Modern machines are fully automatic. This includes guiding the workpiece </strong><strong>and </strong>controlling the pressure and rotation speed of the sanding belt on the material and the area that is to be sanded. For semi-automatic machines, the sanding shoe has to be manually pressed onto the sanding belt and pulled over the length and width of the workpiece. A measuring device or visual examination is used to check when the material has reached its desired surface quality. Once the desired results have been reached, if it is determined that more work needs to be done, then this process needs to be repeated. Very course sanding paper is used for processing metal surfaces. This process is used, for example, to <strong>remove welded seams </strong>and then to ensure that the surface is uniformly course. Metal has a higher heat resistance than wood, and so the sanding belt machine can be used at a higher speed. Large safety precautions are not needed on these machines because there are no components that pose a high level of risk. However, an emergency switch is installed onto a long belt sander to stop the machine in the case of an emergency.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_26612\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26612\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/Extrama-belt-saneder-300x285.jpg\" alt=\"Extrama belt saneder\" width=\"300\" height=\"285\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Extrama belt saneder</figcaption></figure> <h2>Working efficiently with a belt sander</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_7447\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-7447 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/LBS-2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Long belt sander\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Long belt sander is efficient when it comes to industrial production</figcaption></figure> <p>There are many possibilities for sanding, polishing or shaping surfaces, and just as many tools and machines available to undertake these processes.

This is the main characteristic that differentiates it from normal belt sanding machines, where these components are horizontally arranged.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_9746\" style=\"width: 284px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-9746\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/edge-sander.jpg\" alt=\"Sanding a piece of wood with the edge sander\" width=\"284\" height=\"157\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Edge sanding machine in a workshop</figcaption></figure> <h2>The purpose of an edge sander</h2> <p>Just like normal belt sanding machines, edge sanders are used to <strong>chamfer, break and deburr the cut and break points</strong> of a workpiece. The vertical arrangement of the sanding unit allows for precise processing. The level of precision can be increased even further by equipping the work table with an <strong>adjustable stop</strong>. Particularly easy to use edge sanders contain a <strong>tilted sanding unit</strong>; these high-end machines allow for angled chamfers to be precisely sanded.</p> <dl id=\"attachment_60800\"></dl> <h2>Areas of application for an edge sander</h2> <p>Edge sanders are commonly used for manually <strong>post-processing wood</strong>. Solid wood, plywood, veneer and chipboard are all types of solid wood products that can be processed using an edging sander. The only materials that cannot be processed on a edge sanding machine are pasty and greasy semi-finished materials like rubber or other soft, organic materials. The stickiness of these materials means that the sanding paper quickly looses its effectiveness. Additionally, a paste-like adhesive contaminant would quickly reappear. Generally, metal can be processed on an edge grinder, and particularly <strong>soft metals</strong> like <strong>aluminium</strong> or <strong>copper</strong> are easily processed on belt grinding machines. However, safety precautions should always be taken into account. For example, if breathed in, metals like zinc and lead can lead to health problems.</p> <h2>Uses of a an edge sander</h2> <p>The main strength of this machine lies in sanding <strong>panel-shaped</strong> components. Floors, side walls, mouldings out of solid wood, beams and frames are best processed on an edge belt sander. The edges can be bevelled in any desired form and the component’s size can be reduced or it can be shortened. <strong>Entire components</strong> can be fitted onto the edge sander if the sanding belt is wide enough. This is commonly used for drawers and doors, in order to form them into the exact shape required.</p> <p></p> <h2>The structure of an edge sander</h2> <p>An edge sander is most commonly formed out several components. There is a <strong>stable</strong> <strong>work table</strong>, upon which the motor and the sanding unit are built. This consists of an<strong> idler pulley and a drive roller</strong>. The drive roller is powered by an electric motor. This generally has a 220V power supply. The idler pulley is mounted within an oblong hole. If the sanding belt is switched, the idler pulley is loosened and moved within the oblong hole. If the idler pulley is pushed towards the drive roller, then the sanding belt is loosened to the extent that it can be taken out. There is a variation of the edge sanding machine, which is hand-held. This device is used for permanently installed corners or particularly large components. Instead of a sanding belt, these electric hand-held machines contain an exchangeable slip ring.</p> <h2>Working with an edge sander</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_9745\" style=\"width: 301px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-9745\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/edge-sanding-machine.jpg\" alt=\"sand the edge at an angle with the edge sanding machine\" width=\"301\" height=\"166\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sanding the edges of a workpiece</figcaption></figure> <p>Switching the <strong>sanding belt</strong> requires experience and sensitivity. If the belt is fixed in too tightly, then it could rip. Sanding edges always wears down the sanding belt to some extent, and it can be damaged quickly. If the belt is inserted too loosely, then it can slip through the drive rollers when in operation. This will interrupt the sanding process because the movement of the belt would suddenly stop. Choosing the right sanding belt also requires knowledge and experience. The choice of sanding belts range from extremely course to very fine belts. <strong>Course</strong> sanding belts are used for stripping and roughing, and to remove excess material. <strong>Fine</strong> sanding paper is used to polish, round and deburr edges, corners and surfaces. In order to obtain the ideal conditions through adjustment work, it is recommended to use <strong>several different grain sizes</strong>. The adjustment work should only be done in an area of several millimetres in size. Pieces that can be sawn, planed or milled should be processed with the appropriate tools. <strong>Thick workpieces to be sanded</strong> create a high level of wear and tear on the sanding belt, as well as posing a fire hazard. Due to the heating up of material, this could lead to discolouration and charring at the point where it is being sanded. After the material has cooled off, these need to be sanded off again. Unnecessary additional costs occur when trying to sand a workpiece evenly over several centimetres. Belt sanders develop a high force, which is <strong>directly</strong> brought upon the workpiece at a <strong>specific point</strong>. The workpiece needs to be <strong>held tightly</strong>, so that it doesn’t jump off the work table and cause injuries. It is particularly important to always keep fingers and other body parts away from the sanding belt. An operating sanding machine is particularly abrasive. If it is unintentionally touched, it could very quickly lead to severe injuries. To make matters worse, injuries resulting from edge belt sanders always have a high infection rate. Therefore, it is recommended to seek medical assistance, after being injured by this machine. High-end edge sanders contain a <strong>stop and a guide</strong>, and ideally a <strong>tool carriage</strong>. The workpiece is placed into the carriage and then guided along the sanding belt. Edge sanders for sale are equipped with the necessary tools to ensure safe operation, and to keep the risk of injury to a minimum. Edge sanders are <strong>very loud</strong> and emit a lot of <strong>dust</strong>. Therefore, an appropriate <strong>hearing and respiratory protection</strong> should be worn. An additional <strong>extraction unit</strong> increases the health &amp; safety aspect of an edge sander for sale. For these machines, this can be easily achieved by using a common industrial vacuum cleaner and a streamlined design for collecting the dust. It is particularly important to ensure that there is no ground dust flying around when processing metals. Metal dust can damage electrical components, causing them to short circuit. The sanding belt itself needs to be well covered. There should be no opportunities to access the belt from outside of the work table’s area. A temperature sensitive safety switch with a bimetal fuse ensures that the machine switches off automatically before it overheats. Finally, the mechanics of a sanding belt’s operation needs to be laid out in such a way, that the sanding belt comes to a halt no more than ten seconds after the electricity is cut off. Working with a sanding machine is generally not so demanding. Briefing and the opportunity to practice on scrap material should be enough to allow assistants to operate an edge sander, and more specifically, to use a used edge sander.</p> <p></p> <h2>Suppliers of edge sanders</h2> <p>Hand-held edge sanders for construction sites and for processing large workpieces are sold by the companies SKI-MAN and ELA LACHNER. Simple table-top units are available from WEGOMA, HOLZMANN, UNILEV and BERNARDO. Particularly high-end edge sanders that are very well equipped are sold by the companies SCHMIDT, WEIBERT, SCHEPPACH and LANGZAUNER. LANGZAUNER also offers a double-sided edge sander for sale, which can highly increases a company’s efficiency.</p>"},{"id":"1495_en","content":"<p><p><b>Other products in agriculture</b></p>\r\n<table class=\" aligncenter\" style=\"width: 100%;height: 140px;margin-top: -10px\" cellspacing=\"10\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/vermeer/605superm\" title=\"Vermeer 605 SUPER M\">Vermeer 605 SUPER M</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/mccormick/mtx200\" title=\"McCormick MTX200\">McCormick MTX200</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/8400\" title=\"John Deere 8400\">John Deere 8400</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/krone/amr320\" title=\"Krone AMR 320\">Krone AMR 320</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/valtra/s374\" title=\"VALTRA S374\">VALTRA S374</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/8310rt\" title=\"John Deere 8310RT\">John Deere 8310RT</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/kuhn/sr112\" title=\"Kuhn SR 112\">Kuhn SR 112</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/fendt/828varioprofi\" title=\"Fendt 828 Vario Profi\">Fendt 828 Vario Profi</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/claas/axion950cmatic\" title=\"Claas Axion 950 CMATIC\">Claas Axion 950 CMATIC</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/new-holland/boomer20\" title=\"New Holland Boomer 20\">New Holland Boomer 20</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/krone/comprima\" title=\"Krone Comprima\">Krone Comprima</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/kubota/gr2110\" title=\"Kubota GR2110\">Kubota GR2110</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/3720\" title=\"John Deere 3720\">John Deere 3720</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/8500\" title=\"John Deere 8500\">John Deere 8500</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/brent/774\" title=\"Brent 774\">Brent 774</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/9430\" title=\"John Deere 9430\">John Deere 9430</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/claas/liner3500\" title=\"Claas Liner 3500\">Claas Liner 3500</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/new-holland/499\" title=\"New Holland 499\">New Holland 499</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/9650w\" title=\"John Deere 9650W\">John Deere 9650W</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/235\" title=\"John Deere 235\">John Deere 235</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/brillion/ssb12\" title=\"Brillion SSB12\">Brillion SSB12</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/dammann/anp5030\" title=\"Dammann ANP 5030\">Dammann ANP 5030</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/mccormick/mc115\" title=\"McCormick MC115\">McCormick MC115</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/mccormick/x7.650\" title=\"McCormick X7.650\">McCormick X7.650</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/claas/ru600\" title=\"Claas RU 600\">Claas RU 600</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/5520\" title=\"John Deere 5520\">John Deere 5520</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/claas/vario750\" title=\"Claas Vario 750\">Claas Vario 750</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/case-ih/3208\" title=\"Case IH 3208\">Case IH 3208</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/7420\" title=\"John Deere 7420\">John Deere 7420</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/9360r\" title=\"John Deere 9360R\">John Deere 9360R</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/new-holland/workmaster50\" title=\"New Holland Workmaster 50\">New Holland Workmaster 50</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/z910a\" title=\"John Deere Z910A\">John Deere Z910A</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/same/iron\" title=\"Same Iron\">Same Iron</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/3350\" title=\"John Deere 3350\">John Deere 3350</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/xuv835m\" title=\"John Deere XUV835M\">John Deere XUV835M</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/bush-hog/3815\" title=\"Bush Hog 3815\">Bush Hog 3815</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/new-holland/fx50\" title=\"New Holland FX50\">New Holland FX50</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/835r\" title=\"John Deere 835R\">John Deere 835R</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/horsch/tiger4as\" title=\"Horsch Tiger 4 AS\">Horsch Tiger 4 AS</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"//trademachines.com/john-deere/612fc\" title=\"John Deere 612FC\">John Deere 612FC</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2><strong>Sawmill Machine Uses and Prices - Portable &amp; Stationary Sawmills</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The use of sawing machines is relatively restricted, due to their special applications. Processing large round logs is the first step required after the timber has been felled. Saw mills are used by the forestry sector and companies that specialize their operations on processing raw timber. <strong><strong>One of the biggest differentiating factors between the different saw mills is whether they use stationary or mobile machines. </strong></strong>A mobile saw mill has the advantage, that it can work in close proximity to where the timber is sourced, which prevents the need for transporting the very long, round logs. This also means that waste products, like bark and saw chips can, under the right circumstances, be used on site for soil improvement. However, the cutting capacities of mobile machines are more limited. Therefore, mobile saw mill machines are more suited for smaller operations.</p>\r\n<p>Sawmills are durable machines that are designed to serve for years. Therefore, investing in a high-quality machine is most certainly worth it in the long run. Buying new, though, can require a significant investment, the best way to reduce costs is by buying used machinery. TradeMachines collected the best-used sawmills from all over the world for you.

Traditionally hand held, a fladder offers the opportunity to give a truly tailored sanding experience; it helps finish wood, metal, and other surfaces by deburring, polishing, brushing, and sanding the material. Fladder machines are included in the <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/sanding-polishing\">sanding &amp; polishing machines </a></strong>category.</p> <h2>How Does a Fladder Sander Work?</h2> <p>Unlike a belt sander, where the unit requires a flat surface and the wood or surface to be static, the <strong>fladder</strong> allows the user to <strong>effectively wield the sander in whatever manner is needed</strong>. This can mean that smooth shapes can be sanded into the wood, or that wood with inconvenient shaping can be sanded in much the same way as a standard plank. The fladder machine is very simple yet incredibly effective; the fladder and the sanding drum are all that is needed, and the entire setup can be purchased cheaply.</p> <h2>Buying a Fladder Machine</h2> <p>The benefit of a <strong>fladder machine</strong> is that the drum is the only part that will truly wear down, and this is the piece that is easily replaced, making a second hand purchase a real bargain.</p> <p>Manufacturers such as MAKITA, BLACK &amp; DECKER, DEWALT, WICKES, BOSCH, RHYAS, MUHLACKER, JCB, FLADDER DENMARK A/S <span style=\"line-height: 1.5\">and DRAPER supply a range of sanders that are compatible with the fladder system.</span></p>"},{"id":"1502_en","content":"<h2>Profile Sanders</h2> <p><strong style=\"background-color: initial\">Profile sanding machines used</strong> in part manufacturing for wood and metals ensure products are sanded and finished perfectly.</p> <p>Zimmerman offers profile sanding machines like the PS 0 designed for rasping and sawing of metal.

If part of the machine requires power, this can usually be provided by the tractor as well. A typical agri machinery has to move and process relatively large volumes and masses, and must operational in all circumstances, including adverse weather conditions. Energy efficiency has always been important for the <strong>agriculture machines</strong>. Classic farm machinery is therefore built to be robust and functional so to acquire used farm equipment could be very efficient.</p>\r\n<h2>Buying Used Farm Machinery for Sale at Auctions</h2>\r\n<p>Agriculture machinery can be classed as equipment that is used in the operation of a farm or other facility for the cultivation of plants and animals for consumption and other purposes. The period of the Industrial Revolution saw a great leap forward in the speed and efficiency of agriculture equipments used to aid in farming and the increased effectiveness of the processes by which agriculture was effected. The advent of modern steam engines power and the traction engine enabled machinery in the developed world to largely take over the heavy pulling work previously undertaken by oxen, horses and other domesticated animals. The internal combustion engine brought to agriculture a golden era which, to a great extent, we still enjoy today. The basic methodology of such equipment has changed relatively recently since the 20th century. Computer monitoring systems, GPS and programmable controls have all helped to make the operator's work easier, but the designs of farming equipment remain essentially the same, so that you know that when you buy <strong>second hand farm machinery</strong> you will be investing in <strong>agriculture equipments</strong> that have been solidly tested the world over and which have stood the test of time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Used agriculture machinery</strong> can be found quickly and easily at auction. Among <strong>farm machinery sales</strong>, farm equipment auctions allow you to browse a wide selection of farming implements at your convenience and locate a real bargain. However, there can be a bewildering array of <strong>used agricultural tools and equipment</strong> offered online so that it's very useful to have one comprehensive and well trusted site listing a huge range of items from a plethora of locations.</p>\r\n<h3>Development of Agriculture Equipment</h3>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6892\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6892\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/harvester_claas-300x148-300x148.jpg\" alt=\"Harvester at farm\" width=\"300\" height=\"148\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">CLAAS Harvesters are very popular on the second hand market</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>An increase in the use of information technology in the agricultural sector and in the <strong>farming equipment</strong> came about during the last few years before the millennium. It's recommendable to buy <strong>used farm equipment</strong> as this develops and changes constantly. An example are the tractors and excavators, monitors replaced individual instruments and control systems on farm tractors dashboard, therefore used tractors for sale or used ag machinery are recommendable to search. Standardized data connections allowed intelligent working tools to be controlled from the driver's cab; these were fully integrated into the control system of the towing vehicle. Satellite navigation opened up new ways to optimize work flows in agriculture industry. With a GPS-data logger, the vehicle's parameters like speed, rotation, instantaneous power, fuel economy can be logged and then using the geographical coordinates, can be linked to a load profile. The movements of livestock can also be determined using this method. There are new possibilities to automate keeping livestock, including the implementation of near-field communication in all <strong>farming machines</strong>. In cattle farming, every animal with the corresponding marking or sensor can be identified using a machine. This method is used to individually administer feed or to open and close gates.</p>\r\n<h3>Farm Equipment Types by Applications</h3>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6893\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6893\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/agricaltural_mahinery-300x162-300x162.jpg\" alt=\"Tractor with trailer\" width=\"300\" height=\"162\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tractor delivering fertilisers</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>The spectrum of the types of farm equipment used is just as wide. In addition to the classifications of stationary, self-driven and farm equipment with external drives, the most important differentiation is the area of application for the many special types of <strong>agricultural equipments</strong> available in agricultural technology. Despite the universally applicable tractors, single-application machines including straw balers, milking machines or <a href=\"//trademachines.com/forage-harvesters\"><strong>harvesters</strong></a>, are the most prominent. </p>\r\n<p>Mobile, but not self-driven farm equipment is separated into three groups, depending on the type of towing vehicle. Generally, this vehicle is exclusively used to provide movement. There are numerous types of agricultural and forestry trailers like the plough, harrow, simple hay turning machines, hay sweep, seeding machines, drilling machines and harvesters like the cucumber harvesting machine, which is used to manually harvest low-growing plants like cucumbers or strawberries. The second group are agricultural machines that are not only moved by the tractor, but also powered by it.<br />Attachments like front loaders, rear stackers, dozer blades and snow ploughs, universal spreaders and solid fertilizer distributors are farm machines that don't only require a towing vehicle for movement, but also the power from the vehicle's built-in mechanics. This also includes straw balers and bale wrappers, bale collectors and bale clamps, manure spreaders and honey wagons for distributing slurry. Machines used to prepare the land like digging machines, stone collectors or tillers belong in this machine category. Planting machines like potato planters, and beet &amp; potato harvesters are also in this category. Mowers and threshers that fall into these categories are commonly replaced by a combined harvester with its own motor.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_6894\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6894\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/tractor_acker-300x158-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"Tractor operating on land\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tractor tilling the field</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p>The third group of farm equipment and machines that rely on externally produced power are those that do not move during operation. This includes, for example, irrigation and slurry pumps to help produce liquid fertilizer, ground drill and pile drivers, chaff cutters, wood splitters, circular saws (for example, the sliding table saw), power generators and blowing machines.<br /> <strong>Agriculture machinery</strong> has developed into autonomous machines out of accessory equipment in order to increase performance. The combined harvester, and also the beet harvester, are both particularly noteworthy machines. Further types of autonomous farming machinery include smaller machines from stable and stall technology and special machines for fruit and wine between other different <strong>agricultural equipment</strong>. This includes machines for cellars, wine presses, fruit mills and machines for filtering juice. The agriculture scenario changes with the time and so do the machinery and hence few enterprises and individuals who are interested in testing the efficiency of various machines from different manufacturers and models tend to buy cheap <strong>used farm equipment</strong> in order to save money and resources on brand new ag machinery instead.</p>\r\n<h3>Stationary Farm Equipment</h3>\r\n<p>Stationary machines make up a large part of the agricultural technology field as the used equipment do. In addition to universally applicable machines and devices used for stable technology, there is also specialized livestock equipment available within barn and field technology. For example, the systems for taking care of animal's hooves, cattle brushes, stall ventilators, concrete feeders and automatic drinking systems. Further subcategories found within stationary farm equipments include tank and conveyor systems, dispensing equipment and scales.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Why Used Tractors and Combine Harvesters?</h3>\r\n<p>Tractors perform the majority of work on modern farms. They pull equipment which ploughs, tills, seeds and more. Here you will find a wide selection of <a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\"><strong>used tractors</strong></a> that includes agricultural machinery produced by leading manufacturers such as JOHN DEERE, MASSEY FERGUSON, CASE, FORD, NEW HOLLAND, CATERPILLAR, KUBOTA and MAHINDRA, as well as many lesser known brands. Due to their robust design tractors as well as other kinds of farming  equipment can be relied upon to give many years of excellent service. <a href=\"//trademachines.com/forage-harvesters\"><strong>Used combine harvesters</strong></a> can often be found for sale offered by large factory farms that simply wish to upgrade their machine stock. You can still find forty or even fifty year old items of this category that are still going strong.</p>\r\n<h2>A Wide Range of Other Used Farm Equipment</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"//trademachines.com/seedingdrilling-epuipment\"><strong>Used seeding and drilling equipment</strong></a>, as well as <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/soil-preparation-equipment\">tools used for preparation of soil</a></strong>, is also in ready supply, ready to fulfill this vital function. Fertilizing and plant protection equipment can also be found in the used market, as can feeding equipment and grass and forage processing equipment. On different ends of the scale there is used forestry equipment to be purchased from various dealers and <a href=\"//trademachines.com/garden-and-urban-equipment\"><strong>used garden and urban equipment</strong></a> available to the smaller scale private user. Even <a href=\"//trademachines.com/slurrymanure-equipment\"><strong>used slurry and manure equipment</strong> </a>can be located and purchased from <strong>farm machinery auctions</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/johndeere7810.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-13875 alignright\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/johndeere7810-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"John Deere 7810\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a></p>\r\n<h3>Online Agricultural and Farm Machinery Auctions</h3>\r\n<p>Although the history of auctions can be traced back to 500 B.C., it wasn't until the 17th century that they became relatively commonplace events. In the early years of the 21st century it was reported by the National Auctioneers Association that <strong>agricultural machinery and equipmen</strong>t was one of the fastest growing auction sectors. This trend has continued, aided by the increasing popularity of online auctions. In recent years online<strong> farm machinery auctions</strong> have vastly expanded the parameters of possibility for auctions. Such<strong> farm auctions</strong>, conducted by email, began even before the first web browser for personal computers became available. In 1995 the first internet based auctions grew rapidly in popularity due to the obvious advantages of online auction systems, such as electronic automated bids and the use of search engines to find items quickly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Online farm equipment auctions</strong> offer a fast and easy means of disposing of unwanted inventory, leading to a boon for buyers, who can then be the purchasers of some real bargains.

It is used for manual work and is available in a large range of sizes. A positioner allows for a component to be swung along it's longitudinal axis. <strong>High-end positioners</strong> are equipped with a <strong>multi-axis articulated arm</strong>, which ensures a large freedom of movement. Another term used for a positioner is a “manipulator”.</p> <h2>Types of positioners</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_8252\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8252\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/pos-1-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"heavy multi-axis manipulator \" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Multi-axis manipulator to lift and move heavy devices</figcaption></figure> <p>The term positioner cannot be specifically defined. Basically, a positioner includes every <strong>lifting device</strong> that is used to suitably position a workpiece so that it can be further processed. This includes lifting devices on presses, metal shears, punches, bending benches and even little machine jacks like those that always keep stacks at reach. Other smaller positioners are simply clamping devices that are used in automobile workshops for engine repairs. The engines are either clamped into these or screwed in, which allows for the engine to be manually turned around so that all areas can be easily reached. Mid-sized positioners are used for electronic technology and switchboard construction. These are work tables where the height can be <strong>adjusted </strong>and they can be <strong>pivoted</strong>. These devices are particularly useful for ensuring that the workers can maintain a good posture throughout the working day, especially when working for long periods of time. Most valve positioners are found in heavy-duty industry. With their help, especially large castings and welded constructions can be swung around, enabling them to be further processed. </p> <p>Small lifting tables usually have mechanical or manually operated, hydraulic power. Small aids for assembly work in workshops usually have manual mechanics. Mid-sized positioners are available as <strong>manual mechanical, pneumatic positioner, electric and hydraulic machines</strong>. This includes the turnover positioner and the rotary table. Large positioners are usually only availably as hydraulic machines. Mid-sized positioners have a control system directly on the machine. Large positioners are usually controlled via <strong>remote control</strong> or a <strong>foot pedal</strong>. The carrying capacity of large positioners can be several tonnes. </p> <p>Positioners can be combined with <strong>industrial robots</strong>. These devices can be used for loading, processing and receiving workpieces. This is particularly useful when mass producing of complex and massive components.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_8260\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-8260\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/pos-2-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"Electric lifting table\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Electric lifting table for motorcycles</figcaption></figure> <h2>How positioners are applied</h2> <p>Cast pieces with complex forms usually have deep set cavities and a hollow space where moulding sand collects. The workpiece needs to be completely cleaned before it can be further processed. For producing individual components with different shapes, it is necessary to deliberately fire at all the component's areas that are difficult to reach. A positioner and its optionally connected sandblasters are extremely helpful for this. Complete cast pieces can be ground and deburred using positioners. <strong>Complex welded constructions can be built onto a welding positioner</strong> piece by piece, without the risk of the welding force not being able to reach certain areas. Positioners can also be used for painting jobs. </p> <h4>Working with a Positioner</h4> <p>Positioners are very <strong>easy devices to</strong> <strong>use</strong>. The positioner is put into a horizontal position via its carrier plate and then guided towards the component by a crane. It can pivot very easily after the component and the positioner are tightly screwed to one another. There is no additional training required to operate a positioner; a basic brief should be enough. Positioners often carry components weighing several tonnes, which can develop a high momentum of force. It is important to work slowly and carefully with a positioner, to ensure that the work is safe. The qualification required for working with a <strong>pneumatic valve positioner</strong> is determined by the type of of work that will be undertaken. Sand blasting, cleaning and even painting processes that require a positioner can be undertaken by non-skilled workers. However, sand blasting is a very dangerous task and should only be undertaken after receiving a thorough security brief. The hinges of the positioner should be well protected. Blasting is very abrasive and can easily lead to wear and tear. Packing the hinges with plastic foil is usually suitable enough to prevent this from happening. Welding and drilling work on cast iron pieces and constructions should only be undertaken by specialist staff with the help of a weld postioner. </p> <figure id=\"attachment_8271\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-8271 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/02/pos-3-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"positioner\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Positioner for welding work</figcaption></figure> <p>Positioners are<strong> extremely heavy machines</strong>. They generally require a separate foundation. Due to the combined weight of the heavy positioner, and the often heavy workpieces, positioners' <strong>bearings are under a lot of stress</strong>. These bearings are generally set up to have a <strong>very long working life</strong>. However, it is still advisable to take some care. If the bearings start playing up, squeaking or moving turbulently, it is a sign that they are starting to wear down. If this is not dealt with, then it will become difficult to disassemble the machine and changing the bearings later on. Positioners can move a load in several directions, which means that different levels of force are inflicted upon the device's entire mechanical structure. It is recommended to regularly check the arms for any hair line cracks. This can prevent sudden breakages, which would be dangerous for staff and materials. Ideally, monitoring should be done regularly (in a cycle) and results should be recorded. It is generally recommended that the worker who moves the positioner is the same one that will undertake the further processing work. If the positioner is operated by two workers, then proper communication between the two <strong>must take place</strong>.</p> <h2>Suppliers of Positioners</h2> <p>Particularly interesting positioners, which were especially developed for the production of welded constructions, are available from the companies FÖRSTER and CLOOS. These machines are characterised by their high carrying capacity and precision. A wide choice of one, two and three-axes positioners are available from the industrial robot manufacturers, KUKA and ABB. These companies have a very good customer service, and can give good advice about combining robots and positioners. Large positioners, with a carrying capacity of over 100 tonnes, is part of HEITZE's product range.</p>"},{"id":"1532_en","content":"<h2>The structure of a raised storage platforms</h2> <figure id=\"attachment_15681\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-15681 size-medium\" src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/Mezzanine--300x215.jpg\" alt=\"raised storage platforms\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Raised storage platforms can make extra space with low costs</figcaption></figure> <p>Not all storage units are optimally used. The more versatile the products are that need to be stored, the more complicated the in-house logistics must be. The workspaces that are required for administration and equipment storage should ideally be located in the same area as the objects that need to be stored. This keeps the transportation routes for loading and unloading raw materials, auxiliary materials, operational materials, intermediary and end products to a minimum. If the required workspaces are not available, raised storage platforms can very easily installed. <strong>Modern systems </strong>contain a large <strong>variety of integrated units</strong>. When using components from the same distributor, there are often <strong>intelligent, combined systems available made out of storage platforms, shelves, magazines, assembly platforms and office</strong> <strong>containers.</strong></p> <p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-15691\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/Screenshot_070715_015249_PM.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot_070715_015249_PM\" width=\"206\" height=\"561\" />Storage platforms are quickly mountable systems. With a stable protective support system, simple plug and screw connections, and a large choice of expansion possibilities, they are flexible and can be quickly integrated into all storage systems. Most of the manufacturers use cold-rolled steel profiles, which are particularly robust. There are a variety of materials that are usually used for the platform's floor: cheap and easily replaceable pressed chipboard; decorative and abrasion-resistant plastic panels; non-slip safety mats made out of hard rubber; or galvanised grates. This means that walking on and loading the storage platforms is safe, and they are are designed to suit their intended use. <strong>Storage platforms can have their capacity expanded, adjusted and reconstructed. </strong>Modern systems are so stable that even production components can be laid on these intermediary levels. However, installing heavy machinery on these systems is not very useful. But they can be very well used for small work stations for manual assembly work. Also alternatively, there are <strong>heavylift storage platforms</strong> available in the industrial equipment sales for lifting and storage machinery options. <strong>They</strong> <strong>can span up to 12 meters and can host loads of up to 2500kg per square meter. Therefore, storage platforms are the ideal device when it comes to fitting and expanding a facility's capacity. </strong></p> <p>They can be just as quickly dismantled, as they were installed. The system can be taken apart and reassembled as much as required. If the weight restrictions are not exceeded, then there are usually no components that commonly wear out.</p> <h2>The safety of steel storage platforms</h2> <p>Nowadays, storage platforms are very robust and durable. <strong>The standard screw connections that were used before are now commonly replaced by plug-in connections for rapid assembly. </strong>This means that the regular monitoring of screws, to check if they are tight enough, no longer needs to be undertaken. However, screws are still used to anchor the storage platforms to the floor. Most manufacturers recommend that these screws are checked yearly with a torque wrench. It is also recommended to put protective caps on the screws. Collisions with lifting trucks, <a href=\"//trademachines.com/forklifts\"><strong>forklifts</strong></a><strong>,</strong> or falling components can damage the screw thread. In this case, one could only remove them with force, which usually ends up damaging the component.</p> <p>The most important component of a storage platform is its feet. These are so delicately designed, that they are easy to transport and assemble, but they still have an amazing carrying capacity. However, transportation vehicles are very susceptible to colliding with them. These vehicles are not very fast, but when they are fully loaded, can be extremely heavy. The momentum of this weight can damage the feet during a collision. Because the feet are joined to the storage platform, the collision then has an impact on the whole construction. If a foot is broken or bent, it is usually not sufficient to just change this component. In this case, the whole storage platform needs to be inspected by an independent expert, to ensure that there are no other consequential damages.</p> <h2>Buying Used Storage Platforms</h2> <p><strong>Storage platforms should be thoroughly examined before use.</strong> The damages mentioned above, for example, could turn a seemingly intact storage platform into waste material. In addition to looking for visible damages, it is also recommended to check the corners. <strong>Contrary to machines and devices, the older the paint on a storage platform is, the better. </strong>Storage systems can be scratched up. Freshly painted units are more aesthetically pleasing but there is also the risk that this paint has been applied to hide damages. Therefore, it is better to buy a storage platform with signs of use, and paint it yourself afterwards, than to buy one that has been freshly painted.</p> <figure id=\"attachment_15696\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15696\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/03/storage-platform-300x197.jpg\" alt=\"steel storage platforms\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Storage platforms integrate well in a warehouse</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Storage platforms are well suited for the used market. </strong>If they have been well maintained, they practically do not lose any of their value. This means: as long as they are not damaged, they can always be resold for the same price that they were bought. Buying used systems is particularly efficient.</p> <h3>Accessories for storage platforms</h3> <p>There is a rich and diverse choice of accessories available and there is a comprehensive range of available solutions: <strong>stairs in all sizes; slides; office containers; and lifts or loading stations for forklifts. </strong>Additionally, storage platforms can be <strong>expanded </strong>if they have already <strong>been used for a long period of time.</strong> All storage platforms have standard dimensions, which means that it is <strong>possible </strong><strong>to mix and match products from various manufacturers </strong>without any problems. The subsequent installation of a sprinkler system and a compressed air device is also unproblematic.</p> <h3>Manufacturers of storage platforms</h3> <p>The biggest suppliers of storage platforms are SSI SCHÄFER, KAISER+KRAFT, RACOR and JUNGHEINRICH. Other recommended manufacturers with a good range of accessories includes NOLTE LAGERTECHNIK, BITO, TECRO and SIEPER LAGERTECHNIK GmbH.</p>"},{"id":"1535_en","content":"<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>What is an industrial robot?</strong></h2> <br> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">A robot is defined by the Robotics Institute of America as ‘A reprogrammable multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks.’ <br> Another way to define industrial robotics are computer-controlled, automation systems that combines the technology of digital computers with a feedback system known as servo control.

They are closely connected to what is referred to as <strong>cells</strong> in automation technology, which also undertake a full process. These generally consist of independent machine tools, which are connected to a common workpiece magazine and are controlled by a central computer. The cooperation of the individual machines within a cell is dependent on the circumstances and special handling systems. A compact system can be a modular unit, but in this case it is still made out of different components that are constructed to <strong><strong>work together as a unit. </strong></strong>In most cases, compact machines are <strong><strong>pre-fabricated, transportable units </strong></strong>that act like, and are handled in the same way as, machine tools.</p> <h2><strong>Areas of application: Where are compact systems used?</strong></h2> <p>Compact cells simplify the <strong><strong>structure </strong></strong>of production machines; they are an independent unit that supply all the necessary features needed for a specific process. They are used in various areas of production: in the form of closed-off robot welding cells for metalworking; bread making machines for producing dough; for the production of BSH, laminated wood or other similar materials; compact systems for recycling production waste; or cells for the complete mechanical pre-cleaning stage for waste water treatment. These applications represent the <strong>wide spectrum</strong> of areas where compact machines can be used, and they can be found in a <strong>great variety of different forms</strong>. Their common ground is that they are all used for the automatic operation of production and handling processes. A general requirement for each machine is an <strong><strong>integrated measuring and monitoring function </strong></strong>for the workpieces and the tools' parameters. In production technology, for example, this includes monitoring the wear and tear of tools, and recognising broken tools or functions for collision control. Due to the large range of areas in which compact cells could be applied, the type and scope of the measuring and control devices differ greatly. For example, for compact systems used for waste water treatment really only need to be able to monitor the water levels.</p> <p>The advantage of using a compact system is not only the <strong><strong>increase in productivity,</strong></strong> due to the automatic process. Generally, the integrated controls also lead to a <strong><strong>higher product quality</strong></strong>. This is also the case when treating waste water, when compact cells are used to filter, compact and drain the solid materials. These processes reduce the plant's disposal costs. Another characteristic of compact cells is that they are all have very different shapes and structures. This is mainly due to the different sizes and textures of the workpeices and materials that they are built to process. For example, a bread roll plant can be constructed in the form of a rollable cupboard, while a compact system for processing finished, large, wood workpieces for house construction cannot be transported all at once. Considering the size of the machine tool and the components of a compact system, the modular construction really offers an advantage. The system can be built step by step, following a certain design, and then <strong>expanded </strong>into a compact system, where every step <strong>enhances </strong>the production process and increases productivity.</p> <h2><strong>Who produces compact systems?</strong></h2> <p>The large range of areas where compact systems can be applied is also mirrored by the presence of numerous manufacturers. They range from small to mid-sized facilities, up to large technology corporations like ABB. Other examples of compact system manufacturers for various industrial sectors are BLUMENBECKER, CLOOS, <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.de/hersteller/kuhn\">KUHN</a></strong>, MÜLLER MASCHINEN, SMB

Injection molding is one of the more common methods used to mold thermoplastics however, this method can also be used to mold thermosets and elastomers. But, modifications in equipment and operating parameters must be considered in order to avoid premature cross-linking of these materials. The injection molding process is capable of producing numerous varieties of part designs with intricate details such as threads, springs, and hinges, that too all in a single molding operation. Plastic pellets are fed into a heating chamber and are pushed along by a plunger until they are homogenized and fluidized. The fluid plastic is then forced under high pressure through a nozzle into a relatively cold mold. The fluid plastic conforms to the shape of the clamped mold and upon cooling and solidification, the part is ejected and the process continues.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"> </p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>INJECTION MOULDING VS EXTRUSION</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Injection molding is a cyclic process similar to blow molding but in contrast to extrusion, which is a steady state process. The injection molding process is almost similar to the extrusion method except that in extrusion, the molten material is forced through a die. Hence, higher back pressures may be generated in single screw extrusion machines compared to injection molding machines. The primary function of the screw extruder in injection molding is simply to obtain a melt whereas in an extrusion machine, the screw must mix, homogenize and melt the material. Also to achieve better mixing of the polymers used, the screws used in extrusion process are longer than the ones in injection molding machines. Injection molding has a major advantage over extrusion process as the injection-molded products are discrete items with varying cross sections in each axis. Extruded products are very long and continuous, and have a cross section that is usually constant with respect to the axis of production. Melt viscosity of the plastic is one characteristic which often differentiates extruded resins from injection-molded resins at normal processing temperatures. Extruded plastics often have a higher melt viscosity.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_15343\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15343\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/Injection-Moulding-Machine-300x126.jpg\" alt=\"Injection Moulding Machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"126\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Injection Moulding Machine</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"> </p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>INJECTION MOULDING MACHINE</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The two principal units of an injection moulding machine are: Injection unit &amp; Clamping unit. The injection unit which functions more or less like an extruder is responsible for the melting the polymer to the proper viscosity and injecting it into the mould. It consists of the following major components:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left\">\r\n<li>Hopper</li>\r\n<li>Screw</li>\r\n<li>Barrel</li>\r\n<li>Hydraulic Motor</li>\r\n<li>Injection Cylinder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">As the resin is fed from the hopper to the injection barrel, it is plunged forward by the rotation of the screw. During this rotational movement, the resin is primarily melted by the frictional heat supplemented by the heating of the barrel encasing the screw. The screw has three distinct zones (Feed zone, Compression zone and Metering zone) just like in an extruding machine which further processes the resin prior to actual injection. The screw also acts as a ram to inject the molten plastic into the mould. Non-return valve provided at the tip of the screw prevents the back flow of the melt along the screw threads. The most common injection system mechanism used is the reciprocating screw type, but the two-stage screw type is also used rarely in few cases. The clamping unit performs the following functions: holds two halves of mold in proper alignment with each other, opens and closes the mould at the appropriate time and finally keeps the mould closed by the application of a clamping force during the moulding cycle. The clamping system may be either hydraulic, mechanical or a combination of the two.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>INJECTION MOULD</strong></h2>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_15338\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-15338\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/1200px-Injection_moulding.jpg\" alt=\"Injection Moulding Diagram\" width=\"400\" height=\"209\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Injection Moulding Diagram</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Injection mould is the important part of the system as it decides the size and shape of the part to be produced. They are custom designed and fabricated based on the requirements of the final product. The basic elements of an injection mould are: Cavity (Stationary platen), Core (Moving platen) and Distribution channel. The distribution channel consists of the passage through which the polymer melt flows from the nozzle to the mold cavity. Sprue, Runners and Gates form the distribution passage. Ejection pins are built onto the moving half of the mould to eject the molded part from cavity at the end of the molding cycle. Cooling system is made up of passages in the mold that are connected to an external pump through which water is circulated to remove heat from the hot plastic. The injection mould is also equipped with air vents to permit evacuation of air from cavity as the polymer melt rushes in. Various types of mould used are:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left\">\r\n<li>Two-plate mold</li>\r\n<li>Three-plate mold</li>\r\n<li>Hot-runner mold</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The major advantages of the injection moulding process include its versatility in moulding a wide range of products, the ease with which automation can be introduced, high production rates, low labor costs, high reproducibility of complex details and manufacturing of articles with close tolerances and excellent surface finish. Through this technique, even parts with metal inserts can be produced. High tool and die cost is one of the limitation of this process. Although injection molding dies are expensive to produce, each die can be used to make several thousands of components at a very rapid pace, so that the cost per piece is very low. Process is economical only in mass production as the cost of mould is very high and hence not suitable for small runs. It is a precision technique capable of producing complicate and intricate shapes but the major challenge is to design the mould in such a way that the part is ejected out successfully.

The thermoplastic or thermoset polymer, usually in the form of granules or powder, is fed from a hopper on to the rotating screw. It is then conveyed along the barrel where the plastic gets heated up by conduction from the barrel heaters and shear due to its movement along the screw. The depth of the screw channel is reduced along the length of the screw so as to compact the material. At the end of the extruder the melt passes through a die possessing the required cross section to produce an extrudate of the desired shape. It is cooled with a spray of water and drawn away from the die exit at a controlled rate. The extrudate can then be wound on a spool, cut to a preferred length by a plastic extrusion machine operator, or directed into another machine for further processing.</p> <h3><strong>Extrusion vs Injection Moulding</strong></h3> <p><figure id=\"attachment_15507\" style=\"width: 230px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-15507\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/extrusion-machine-surplex-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"MIR RMP 135 V / BS / 360 Extrusion Machines\" width=\"230\" height=\"230\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a title=\"//trademachines.com/mir/rmp135vbs360\" href=\"//trademachines.com/mir/rmp135vbs360\" target=\"_blank\">MIR RMP 135 V / BS / 360 Extrusion Machines</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p>Extrusion is a steady state process in contrast to injection molding or blow molding, which are cyclic processes. This steady-state characteristic yields some unique benefits and challenges as a manufacturing process. The injection molding process is almost similar to the extrusion method except that in injection molding, the molten material is injected into a mold rather than forced through a die. Hence, higher back pressures may be generated in single screw <strong>extrusion machines</strong> compared to injection molding machines. The primary function of the screw extruder in injection molding is simply to obtain a melt whereas in a <strong>plastic extrusion machine</strong>, the screw must mix, homogenize and melt the material. Also to achieve better mixing of the polymers used, the <strong>screws used in extrusion process are longer than the ones in injection molding machines</strong>. Extruded products are very long and continuous, and have a cross section that is usually constant with respect to the axis of production. Injection-molded products are discrete items with varying cross sections in each axis. Melt viscosity of the plastic is one characteristic which often differentiates extruded resins from injection-molded resins at normal processing temperatures. Extruded plastics often have a higher melt viscosity.</p> <h3><strong>Extrusion Machine for Sale<br /></strong></h3> <p><figure id=\"attachment_15509\" style=\"width: 465px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-15509\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/extrusion-machine-surplex1.jpg\" alt=\"IDE ME60 Extrusion Machine\" width=\"465\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a title=\"//trademachines.de/ide/me60\" href=\"//trademachines.de/ide/me60\" target=\"_blank\">IDE ME60 Extrusion Machine</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p>The major extrusion machine parts can be divided into components that are upstream and downstream to the extruder and the extruder itself. Upstream components include resin handling equipment which conveys the raw materials to the extruder and resin conditioning equipment that will pre-heat the resin before entering the <strong>extruder system</strong>, thereby controlling its moisture content. The downstream components usually include a molten resin filter, the extrusion die assembly, the quenching tank for cooling and finally a product cut-off device. The two main components of a <strong>plastic extruder machine for sale</strong> are barrel and screw. The screw which is chiefly responsible for the melting of the plastic can be further subdivided into three zones namely,</p> <ul> <li>Feed zone which maintains the optimum supply of pre-heated resin to the subsequent zones</li> <li>Compression zone where the material is squeezed and compressed to liquid</li> <li>Metering zone where the melt is homogenized and supplied at uniform temperature and pressure to the die.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Extrusion and its Types</strong></h3> <p>Extrusion is commonly categorized based on the following three parameters:</p> <ul> <li>Direction of Flow – Forward and Backward</li> <li>Operating Temperature – Cold and Hot</li> <li><strong>Extrusion Equipment</strong> – Horizontal and Vertical</li> </ul> <p>In forward extrusion, the metal is forced to flow in the same direction as the punch whereas in backward extrusion the metal flows in the direction opposite to the punch movement. Cold extrusion is the process done at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures. Hot extrusion is done at fairly high temperatures, approximately 50 to 75 % of the melting point of the metal and at very high pressures ranging from 35 – 700 Mpa. Due to high temperatures and pressure it has a detrimental effect on the die life as well as on the other working components. Based on the direction of travel of the ram, the <strong>extrusion presses</strong> are classified as horizontal and vertical. Vertical presses have a higher production rate and occupy less factory space than their horizontal counterparts. Also deformation is non-uniform due to varying temperatures between top and bottom parts of the billet in horizontal presses.</p> <h3><strong>Applications of Plastic Extrusion Machinery</strong></h3> <p><figure id=\"attachment_15513\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15513\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/extruded-aluminum-300x130.jpg\" alt=\"Extruded aluminium section\" width=\"300\" height=\"130\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Extruded aluminium section</figcaption></figure></p> <p>The <strong>extrusion machine process</strong> has a few exclusive advantages when compared to other plastic processing techniques like low tool costs, ability to process complex profile shapes, and speedy processing even though it is limited to parts of uniform cross section.

Silicon, germanium and carbon are the most common semiconductors. Semiconductors, often referred to as computer chips or integrated circuits (ICs), contain numerous electrical pathways which are capable of connecting to a number of transistors and other electronic components. The information is stored by these transistors on the semiconductors, either by holding an electrical charge or by holding little or no charge. <br>Due to the significant advances in the technology, semiconductor technology is continuously evolving and becoming more prevalent in our lives. Over the past 40 years there has been a tremendous decrease in the size of the individualtransistors. </p> <p><strong>SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING</strong></p> <p> Semiconductor manufacturing can be defined as the process of taking bare silicon wafers and repetitively processing them by adding layers of material which are then patterned and cut into individual chips for use in electronic system. The semiconductor manufacturing process consists of two phases: the wafer process, during which circuit patterns are formed in the wafer, and the assembly process, during which the semiconductors are tested and packaged. The fabrication of integrated circuits often referred to as fab involves a sequence of production steps, which is repeated many number of times as required depending on the complexity of the device. Most fabrication steps are carried out in clean rooms as a high level of impurity and environmental control is desirable at all phases of device manufacturing. </p> <p> <strong>WAFER FABRICATION</strong></p> <p> A typical wafer is cut from a pure silicon ingot. Silicon wafers are produced in different diameters ranging from 200 mm to 300 mm. Today almost all the computer chips are made of silicon wafers as silicon is inexpensive and highly abundant.  After the preparation of the wafers, it has to undergo several processing steps which can be categorized into the following four types:</p> <p><strong>DEPOSITION</strong></p> <p> Deposition is the process of growing, coating, layering or transferring materials onto the wafer. Oxidation and Nitridation are some of the famous growing technologies. Other available technologies include physical vapour deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), electrochemical deposition (ECD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Oxidation forms a thin layer of silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) completely over the wafer surface which acts as a diffusion barrier covering the silicon throughout the entire processing sequence. </p> <p><strong>PATTERNING</strong></p> <p> Patterning is also known as masking, photo masking, photo lithography etc. Photolithography is used to define patterns in the oxide layer and it is done so in the following manner: Applying photo resist as a spun coat on the wafer surface, Exposing a circuit pattern to ultra violet light using a mask or reticle (smaller masks) and Developing the Photo resist.  The photoresist is exposed by a stepper, a machine that focuses, aligns, and moves the mask, exposing select portions of the wafer to short wavelength UV light. Developing the photo resist causes the soft unexposed resist to be removed and the hard photo resist to remain on the wafer surface. </p> <p><strong>REMOVAL</strong></p> <p> Removal or Etching is the process step used to remove the non-patterned oxide layer from the wafer surface after photolithography. A specialized machine called plasma etcher is used to remove the oxide layers not covered by photo resist. Etching can be accomplished in wet or dry chemical systems.  Dry  etching  is  the most  common method and  utilizes gaseous  species  to  generate  reactive  products  that  attack the  surface  to  be  etched. Wet etching involves the use of wet chemicals which react with the material to be removed.</p> <p><strong>IMPLANTATION</strong></p> <p> It is defined as the process step in which controlled amounts of doper are introduced into semiconductor wafer. Dopants are electrically active ions that are added to the wafer to modify the properties of the material. Implantation can be performed before or after the etching process depending upon the desired results. </p> <p><strong>ASSEMBLY PROCESS</strong></p> <p> Assembly is the process of converting fabricated wafers into individually packaged integrated circuits. The assembly operation consists of the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Sawing  the wafer between die</li> <li>Packaging  the die</li> <li>Bonding  die pads to package leads</li> <li>Package  sealing</li> <li>Making  identification marks on package</li> </ul> <p> A packaged die is referred to as the chip or unit. The packaged chips are re-tested to ensure that they were not damaged during packaging.</p> <p><strong>INSPECTION AND CONTROL</strong></p> <p> Physical defects are introduced during manufacturing steps due to equipment and human problems. Defects can be of several types and can cause various problems like distortion in the pattern, open or short circuit, mechanical stress. Some defects may be completely inactive while some may be dormant initially and then get activated at a later point of time which may be dangerous. Defects are identified and rectified by visual inspection and electrical tests during and after wafer fabrication. Die test is the first step carried out on the wafer testing each IC and conforming its compliance to the design specifications. Some chips are also physically damaged during assembly process which are visually recognized and scrapped after assembly. </p> <p> A few of the integrated circuit manufacturing companies in the world are: TOSHIBA, Fujitsu, Freescale, Atmel, BECKHOFF, RENESAS Electronics, Infineon Technologies, Conax Technologies and ST Microelectronics.&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"1591_en","content":"<h2><strong style=\"background-color: initial\">Blow Moulding Machines</strong></h2> <p>Blow molding was initially developed as a method for producing hollow plastic articles such as bottles and barrels and although this is still the largest application area for the process, nowadays a wide range of technical mouldings are also made by this method. Products made using this process usually have thin walls and range in size and shape from small, fancy bottles to automobile fuel tanks. The basic technique of blow molding is to stretch and form plastic material against a mold, usually by air pressure. Blow moulding is relatively a simple process in which a hollow molten preform or tube is placed in a female mold and inflated to conform to the shape of the mold. Thus blow moulding consists of two processing phases: Fabrication of the tubular form and Inflation of the tube.</p> <h2><strong>BLOW MOULDING AND ITS TYPES</strong></h2> <p>In the blow moulding process, a free-blown form shaped like a tube called as the parison made of a heated polymer is positioned in the cavity of a split mould. Hot compressed air is then injected through a needle into the parison, which expands to conform to the shape of the cavity. Based on the method of forming the parison, blow moulding can be sub-divided into two categories namely: Injection blow moulding and Extrusion blow moulding as the tube can be injection moulded allowing a thread for a lid or some other detail to be formed. It can also be extruded as a tube, pinched at one end, and again expanded to fill the cavity of a two part metal mould. There are also many variations on the basic concepts of blow moulding to make the process faster, and more efficient.</p> <h2><strong>EXTRUSION BLOW MOULDING</strong></h2> <p>In extrusion blow molding, a molten tube (parison) is extruded through an annular die, without pre-forming, the bottom of the parison is pinched of by the mold. In simple terms, the extrusion blow molding method extrudes fluid plastic into parison before molding the final product. The parison is directed between two halves of a mold and then air pressure expands the parison forcing it to conform to the contour of the mold. The conventional extrusion blow moulding process may be continuous or intermittent based on the supply of the molten plastic. In the continuous type, when the desired length of the parison is reached, the mould closes around the parison. The parison is cut above the mould and the mould is transferred to a separate station where the parison is blown by compressed air, cooled and finally the article is ejected out of the mould. But in the intermittent parison type, the compressed air is blown through the mould at the same station when the desired length of the parison is reached. The main disadvantage of this method is the less controllable wall thickness, though some basic control is possible.</p> <h2><strong>INJECTION BLOW MOULDING </strong></h2> <p>Injection blow molding is similar to extrusion blow moulding except that the parison is injection-molded rather than being extruded. It is a two-step process where a blank preform is first molded, and then transferred to the mold cavity where it is blown into shape. Injection blow molding consists of the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Parison is injection molded around a blowing rod</li> <li>Injection mold is opened and parison is transferred to a blow mold</li> <li>Soft polymer is inflated to conform to the blow mold</li> <li>Blow mold is opened and the blown product is ejected out.</li> </ol> <p>The advantages of injection blow molding are good control over wall thickness, elimination of bottom pinch off line and no scrap. But it requires two moulds and also involves the transfer time between injection and blow mould.</p> <h2><strong>ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS</strong></h2> <p>Blow moulding is basically flash free and a core less process. It provides rapid production rate, good dimensional precision and excellent consistency between lot to lot. But it is not an environment friendly process. No other method is as fast and efficient as blow moulding for manufacturing hollow containers of thermoplastic polymers. But it is limited for producing only hollow and tubular parts. But, blow moulding is being continually researched upon to increase its capability of producing even more complex shapes. These include unsymmetrical geometries and double wall mouldings. Polyethylene Terephthalate, Polypropylene, Polyethylene, Polycarbonate and Polyvinyl Chloride are the polymers used for blow moulding process. It is important to note that it is not suitable for processing thermosetting polymers. Disposable containers for liquid consumer goods, large shipping drums for liquids and powders, large storage tanks, gasoline tanks, toys, and hulls for sail boards and small boats are some of the blow moulded products.</p> <p>Some of the famous brands in the world which manufacture blow molding machine are: SIPA, KOSME, Urola, ROMI, HESTA, Fong Kee, SIDEL, KHS, Guangdong Jinming, BEKUM, Jomar, KRONES, Meccanoplastica, KAUTEX and TECHNE.  </p>"},{"id":"1590_en","content":""},{"id":"1589_en","content":""},{"id":"1587_en","content":""},{"id":"1586_en","content":""},{"id":"1615_en","content":"<h2>Measuring Equipment</h2> <h4>What is measuring equipment and how does it function?</h4> <p>Measuring equipment is a generic term for various objects that are <strong>used to take measurements</strong>. In addition to measuring devices, there are also<strong> regular aids and reference materials</strong>. Guidelines, like ISO 9000, are used to ensure that the equipment upholds a certain level of quality. For example, the correct way of handling and using this kind of equipment is specified in the ISO 9001. The term itself is defined by the DIN standard 1319 in Part 2, which outlines the standard terms associated with measuring equipment.</p> <h4>The most important means for measuring are measuring devices and measuring equipment</h4> <p>Measuring is to <strong>numerically compare physical quantities with appropriate reference values</strong>. This type of comparison can either be undertaken using the help of a corresponding measuring scale, or indirectly through comparing it to one or more other quantities that are easier to measure. Suitable devices for measuring length include, for example, <strong>rulers, callipers or a micrometer screw gauge</strong>. An indirect measurement is used, for example, by the<strong> liquid thermometer</strong>. This type of measuring device reads the temperature as a length of a liquid column, which changes with a specific value through thermal expansion. In addition to measuring tools, devices and systems is also used to measure quantities. Measuring systems are usually made up of one or more devices and supplementary equipment. The detected measurement is inputted into the measuring device either <strong>mechanically, electrically or optically</strong> and transformed into an output value. In an <strong>analog voltmeter</strong>, for example, a particular level of voltage causes a needle or pointer to move. The digital measuring device then transforms this movement into a numerical value, which is presented on a display.</p> <h4>What does gauging, adjusting and calibrating measuring equipment mean?</h4> <p>In order to assess the quality of the taken measurements, measuring devices and instruments need to be periodically reviewed and adjusted, if necessary. This ensures that they are providing <strong>accurate measurements</strong>. This task is either called <strong>calibrating</strong>, <strong>adjusting or gauging</strong>. During calibration, the <strong>deviation</strong> of the measured value from the <strong>desired value</strong> is distributed to the measuring device, determined and then documented. On the other hand, adjusting methods minimise the level of deviation by intentionally <strong>altering</strong> the measuring device. Gauging is the process of using official guidelines to <strong>test measuring devices</strong>. This is undertaken by approved bodies. If successful, the device is marked to indicate the success. Therefore, calibration is only possible on gauged devices, because adjusting a measuring device would make the previous gauging process invalid. Gauging is demanding and thereby only undertaken on measuring devices where it is legally required.</p> <h4>What is a standard?</h4> <p>When gauging, adjusting and calibrating a piece of measuring equipment, it is <strong>compared</strong> to a known measurement. This known measurement is called a standard. Depending on the type of measuring device that needs to be adjusted, the standard can either be a measurement standard, a measuring device or piece of equipment. The measurements, or other properties used to measure a standard can only be identified as known, if it has also been gauged and calibrated itself. Due to this, there is a chain called the<strong> calibration hierarchy</strong>, built upon an international standard. Comparing this kind of equipment to the international standard is the most demanding form of calibration. Therefore, it is only used by national institutions for their own national standards. In Germany, this is undertaken by the Physikalisch Technischen Bundesanstalt PTB. Further standards are then <strong>derived</strong> on the national standards. Every step reduces the accuracy of the standard, but also the demand of calibrating. Due to cost, the equipment should be implemented appropriately: its level of accuracy needs to fit the requirements of the task.</p> <h4>What are reference materials and why are they needed?</h4> <p>Not all measuring equipment can provide accurate figures. For example, two thermocouples can be used to accurately measure the temperature difference. In order to get the <strong>absolute</strong> temperature, one of the two needs to be adjusted to the <strong>known temperature</strong>. In this instance, a mixture of crushed ice and water can be used as a reference material. Reference materials are necessary when measuring chemical components. For example, gasses with known compositions are usually used as a reference material for the calibration of exhaust gas measuring instrumentation.</p> <h4>Areas of application for measuring equipment</h4> <p>It is used to detect <strong>mechanical</strong>, <strong>thermal</strong>, <strong>electrical</strong>, <strong>optical</strong> and <strong>magnetic</strong> <strong>measurements</strong>. They are used to <strong>control and monitor machines and processes</strong>, <strong>to ensure the compliance of manufacturing tolerances</strong>,<strong> and to</strong> <strong>regulate</strong> machines and other measuring equipment. This equipment is required for production, as well as for quality assurance. The quality of measuring instrumentation and its surroundings has a strong influence on the <strong>accuracy</strong> of the measurements that they take. Precise measurements are essential for a high production quality. High-end equipment and their maintenance is relatively cost intensive. However, they provide achievable improvements to the production quality, which ultimately leads to savings e.g. by reducing the amount of waste material. This is undertaken, for example, by grouping together products or components with the same actual value of particular properties. This is particularly common for electronic components. It allows for the use of single batches of components with significantly tighter tolerances, as predetermined by their production. Measuring equipment is required for a lot of these tasks, as well as to measure the properties of products or components, and to monitor and check the equipment. There are measuring devices available that are more or less universal and can be compared to an SI unit. These were conceptualised for very specific uses. The first group contains weights, gauge blocks and scales. The second group has devices to measure surface roughness and standards for groove spacing and depth. Devices like microscopes can also be considered a piece of measuring instrumentation, if they are used to determine the quantitative qualities of an object.</p> <h2>Who produces measuring equipment?</h2> <p>Some of the companies who produce measuring equipment includes <strong>ATOS</strong>, <strong>CARL</strong> <strong>ZEISS</strong>, <strong>DMG</strong> <strong>MORI</strong> <strong>SEIKI</strong>, <strong>FLUKE</strong>, <strong>GOSSEN</strong> <strong>METRAWATT</strong>, <strong>HAMEG</strong>, <strong>HEXAGON</strong> <strong>METROLOGY</strong> (also known as <strong>LEITZ</strong>), <strong>HOMMEL</strong> <strong>WERKE</strong>, <strong>MAHR</strong>, <strong>SMU</strong>, <strong>TAYLOR</strong> <strong>HOBSON</strong> and <strong>VLSI</strong>.</p> <h2>Measuring Equipment Sales</h2> <p>Used measuring equipment that suits your needs can be found on very few places online.

style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is a four-way forklift?</span></h2>\r\n<p><b>Four-way forklifts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (also known as </span><b>multi directional forklifts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) are large, wheel-assisted forklifts with a design of a cross-seat reach truck. All wheels of the truck can be rotated 90° so that the direction of movement can be changed 90° at a time without having to turn off. The design also allows the truck to move transversely. The four-way forklifts are therefore characterised by very high manoeuvrability, which is why they are used for the storage and retrieval of goods in </span><b>narrow aisle warehouses</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition, bulky long goods can be transported and stored using four-way stackers and returnable stackers. These models are equipped with suitable</span><b> long fork carriers.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The carriers have a greater distance between the tines. Four-way forklifts and returnable forklifts are used both by classic warehouse logistics specialists and in pallet warehouses, for example in DIY stores or by window producers. Significantly shorter picking and handling times than in the case of other forklifts speak in favour of their use.</span></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33803 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2017/03/four-way-forklift-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"four-way forklift\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Characteristics of four-way forklift trucks</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To minimise the risk of tipping, the truck's centre of gravity is located inside the wheel base. Thanks to this design, the four-way stackers can be used wherever companies have to struggle with lack of space, e.g. in narrow aisle warehouses.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The four-way stacker is equipped with </span><b>rigid forks</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> mounted on a movable </span><b>lifting mast</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The lift mast is hydraulically pushed forward by rollers, which insert the forks underneath the loading unit. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In contrast to conventional reach trucks, which can only pick up and transport the load in the direction of movement, the four-way forklifts can take curves and even move sideways thanks to the 90° rotating wheels. As the four-way stacker does not require any rotation in the rack aisle during storage or retrieval, the turning circle does not have to be taken into account for the aisle width. The operator can drive across the aisle until he has reached his destination. This is particularly advantageous for storage and retrieval in rack warehouses, where the racks are very close to each other.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even more flexible than four-way forklifts are </span><b>returnable forklifts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in which the wheels can be turned over 90°. With the multi-directional stacker, the driver can control any direction of travel and even turn on the spot. The multidirectional truck can be rotated on the spot using specially designed Mecanum wheels which are not connected to the steering axle.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are the types of four-way forklifts?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Four-way and returnable forklifts can be powered by both electric and internal combustion engines. As electrically driven forklifts are emission-free and quiet, they can be used in closed warehouses. The modern versions of electric four-way forklifts reach maximum capacities of up to 20 tons and can lift loads up to 10m. Diesel or gas powered models are used outdoors due to emissions. A great advantage of these models is their particularly robust construction, thanks to which they can work safely and without accidents even in adverse environmental conditions. They can even do their job well on unpaved terrain.  </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are leading four-way forklift manufacturers?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some of the most popular manufacturers of four-way forklift trucks are among others: </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hubtex</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Combi-Lift</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BT</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fenwick</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fantuzzi</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Baumann</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jumbo</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Linde</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Palfinger </span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sichelschmidt</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where can I buy a used four-way forklift?</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The price range for a new multi directional forklift lies between $20,000 and $170,000 or more. Used equipment is obviously much cheaper. When buying a </span><b>used four-way forklift</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> you can save up to 50%, depending on the age, running time and condition of the vehicle. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On TradeMachines.com you can compare the offers of many auction houses before the purchase of your machine.
