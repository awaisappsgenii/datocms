It offers excellent handling and an impressive power output. Otherwise known as the <strong>JD 110</strong>, this garden tractor was built between 1963 and 1974 as part of the \"100 series\" tractors offered by this well-known company. In fact, the JOHN DEERE 110 lawn tractor can actually be broken down into two separate categories. These are those with rounded fenders (1963 until 1967) and the square versions seen in subsequent versions. The next model up is the JOHN DEERE 210 and a larger variant can be seen in the JOHN DEERE 112 line. The original price for the JOHN DEERE 110 lawn tractor was $1,115 dollars (1974). Thus, anyone looking to buy used JOHN DEERE 110 mowers is likely to encounter substantial rebates. As with most other models, this unit is characterised by its green and yellow paint scheme. An open-air cab allows for easy operation.</p>\r\n<h2>JOHN DEERE 110 Garden Tractor Specs</h2>\r\n<p>The JOHN DEER 110 lawn tractor is powered by either a Kohler 161 engine (1963) or the slightly more advanced Kohler 181 (from 1964 until the end of production). Both are air-cooled petrol engines while the 181 series offers 305 cubic centimeters (the 161 only had 277). Both are air-cooled engines and each has one cylinder. This is the primary reason why up to ten horsepower is supplied by the JOHN DEERE 110 garden tractor.</p>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25788\" style=\"width: 400px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-25788\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/12/JOHN-DEERE-110-Lawn-Tractor.jpg\" alt=\"JOHN DEERE 110 Lawn Tractor\" width=\"400\" height=\"226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">JOHN DEERE 110 Lawn Tractor Engine</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>The JOHN DEERE 110 garden tractor <strong>weighs</strong> only 615 pounds (258 kilograms). This makes it ideal for home use and <strong>light work.</strong> An overall <strong>length</strong> of 63 inches (160 centimeters) and a <strong>height</strong> of 38.75 inches (98 centimeters) also emphasise the rather diminutive dimensions of the 110 JOHN DEERE series. Still, a wheel base of 44 inches (11 centimeters) provides excellent stability. Two-wheel drive is only provided in the 110 series. An open-air cab further defines the JOHN DEERE 110 lawn tractor. Manual steering and brakes are also present; common for designs of this era. Its tank has the capacity to hold 1.9 gallons of petrol (7.2 liters).</p>\r\n<h2>JOHN DEERE 110 Backhoe Options For Sale</h2>\r\n<p>A JOHN DEERE 110 for sale can often be equipped with other features. Two of the most common are a 38-inch middle-mounted mower deck and a slightly larger version of 46 inches. This will dictate the overall cutting width that is required. Note that when considering any used JOHN DEERE 110 for sale, the condition of these attachments should always be taken into account.

This led onto the manufacture of lathes and other machine tools.</p>\r\n<h3>Why Used MATRA Takamazattack is the Best Option For You</h3>\r\n<p>The <strong>longevity</strong> of this machine has been proved by the fact that it still works decades after its manufacture. Being a bar loader makes it <strong>more efficient</strong> than previous models as each piece of bar metal can be fed through when needed. The object to be manufactured is rotated on its axis as the piece of metal is cut into the correct size and shape by<strong> removing unwanted material</strong>, a process sometimes known as subtractive manufacturing. The whole lathe operation is computer <strong>controlled</strong> giving the machine an <strong>efficient advantage</strong> so making it really worthwhile to seek out a <strong>used MARTA takamazattack for sale.</strong></p>"},{"id":"21292_en","content":"<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-21293\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/09/hettich-logo-300x189.jpg\" alt=\"hettich logo\" width=\"249\" height=\"157\" /></p>\r\n<h3>HETTICH BLUE MAX 6/ FS Fitting Drilling Machine</h3>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-21294\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/09/HETTICH-BLUE-MAX-6-FS-fittings-drilling-machine-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"HETTICH BLUE MAX 6 FS fittings drilling machine\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />HETTICH BLUE MAX 6/ FS is a <strong>fittings drilling machine</strong> from the house of <strong>HETTICH.</strong> This model ,BLUE MAX 6/ FS, <strong>weighs</strong> approximately 150 kilogrammes and its <strong>dimensions</strong> are approximately 3000 x 650 x 1600 millimetres, going by the HETTICH BLUE MAX 6/ FS specs.

After few design updates, this quality panel saw remains the benchmark for precision cutting and minimal maintenance. Essential in any workshop, the F45 model is a symbol of technology and modern design.</p>\r\n<p>The F45 especially combines high torsion resistance with a very low level of vibrations. The solid machine frame ensures rock solid stability whilst the F45 double roller carriage provides accurate cuttings of panels. The Altendorf F45 table saw is not only renowned for its precision, but also for its ease of movement.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_16740\" style=\"width: 150px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-16740 size-thumbnail\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/07/Altendorf-F45-Panel-Saw-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Altendorf F45 Panel Saw\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Altendorf F45 Panel Saw</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<h3>Altendorf F45 Features </h3>\r\n<p>It also features overhead controller as well as increased motorization and programmability through LCD and touch screen controllers. Three control units are available, allowing the operator to move up to four axles and tilt the saw unit to either side (up to 46° in either direction), even for the entry-level option. All control units, with which the saw blade height and tilt functions are determined, are installed at eye level in order to make the operator's life much easier. The colour screen, which has a 90 mm diagonal, is thus visible from any working position, offering ease-of-use, flexibility and safety. For example, the corrected measurement for the end stop is displayed on the control unit screen. Furthermore, one essential step is to configure precisely the options according to your needs since the control unit can only control the installed hardware.</p>\r\n<p>The Altendorf F45 includes additional features. With the crosscut-mitre fence with integral length compensation, you are able to cut angles and mitres precisely in one operation. When handling longer workpieces, the front support roller on the right-hand side is optimal. Additionally, the toolbox is a closable container able to hold up to six tool carriers ready to use.</p>\r\n<h2>Used Altendorf F45 Table Saw</h2>\r\n<p>Altendorfmanufacters one of the most well-known  sliding table saws in the Markt. The price attached to this table saw is pretty high and can be out of reach for small or staring woodworking workshops that do need the efficiency and quality of the Altendorf F45. GoodSalution for this problem is buying used Altendorf F45 table saw. Almost half the price of a new machine one can get a used  Altendorf F45. </p>\r\n<h4>Product Pictures of Altendorf F45</h4>\r\n<table style=\"height: 28px;background-color: #ffffff\" width=\"335\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_16752\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-16752 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/07/Altendorf-F45-Sliding-Table-Saw1-300x184.jpg\" alt=\"Altendorf F45 Sliding Table Saw\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Altendorf F45 Sliding Table Saw</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_16746\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-16746 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/07/Altendorf-F45-ELMO-3D-300x184.jpg\" alt=\"Altendorf F45 ELMO-3D\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Altendorf F45 ELMO 3D</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_16741\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-16741 size-medium\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/07/Altendorf-F45-Serie-300x193.jpg\" alt=\"Altendorf F45 Serie\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Altendorf F45 Serie</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>The Altendorf F45 series are characterised by quality features:</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Absolute precision aluminium sliding table with large rollers</li>\r\n<li>Sliding carriage locking in every position</li>\r\n<li>On/off buttons located on the sliding carriage</li>\r\n<li>Programmable rip fence with maximum cutting width of 51 inches (1295mm)</li>\r\n<li>Screen control with data entry keypad and clipboard holder</li>\r\n<li>USB interface for data transfer</li>\r\n<li>2 axis scoring unit with motorized vertical and lateral adjustment</li>\r\n<li>10 HP main motor</li>\r\n<li>Large overhead blade guards with dust port</li>\r\n<li>Integrated multi-tap transformer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Altendorf F45 Dimensions</h3>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16745\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/07/Altendorf-F45-Dimensions.jpg\" alt=\"Dimensions Altendorf F45 \" width=\"800\" height=\"392\" /></p>\r\n<p>When looking for used Altendorf F45 for sale and starting to evaluate the cost of transportation, it is very important to know the machine weight and dimensions.</p>\r\n<h3>Comparison of Altendorf F45 Series Specs</h3>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16742\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/07/Altendorf-F45-Series-Specs.jpg\" alt=\"Specs Altendorf F45 Series\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" /></p>\r\n<p> As you can see above, different models are currently available in the Altendorf F45 series.

To distinguish these models from the later types that are now very common, often referred to as \"Type F0\". The machine was intended mainly for the production of stamping dies. But in the early 1930s, the model has been enriched for FP1 a group of machines that can be considered as prototypes. These first models had a table feed rate of 250 mm (300 mm for later models). By the end of world war 2, in 1945 approximately 4100 machines of FP1 were produced. Manufacturing camera shutters remained the center of their business. Even in 1953 the 50th anniversary of the company, their brochure was devoted almost exclusively to camera-associated products. By early 50's and with the introduction of new versions of FP1, fp2 and other high-quality milling machines and accessories a new company was created, separate from camera products. The results were impressive so much that until 1965 approximately 50,000 copies of the FP1 milling machine were sold.</p>\r\n<h4>DECKEL FP1Video</h4></p>\r\n"},{"id":"15280_en","content":"<h3><strong>Ford 4000 All Purpose Tractor </strong></h3>\r\n<table class=\"alignright\" style=\"height: 197px;background-color: #ffffff\" border=\"3\" width=\"199\" cellspacing=\"0,5\" cellpadding=\"0,5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-15265  aligncenter\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/06/Ford-e1447671279373.jpg\" alt=\"ford 4000 tractor\" width=\"146\" height=\"85\" /></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">Founded: June 16, 1903</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">Headquarters: Dearborn, Michigan US</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_13431\" style=\"width: 500px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"  wp-image-13431\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/03/ford-4000.jpg\" alt=\"ford 4000 utility tractor\" width=\"500\" height=\"273\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">FORD 4000 utility tractor</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p> In November 1915, Henry Ford organized the Henry Ford and Son Company to develop a farm tractor and build a tractor factory, because the other stockholders of the Ford Motor Company didn’t want their rich dividends diluted by the cost of developing a tractor.By 1964, a whole new Ford tractor range included no less than three tractors featuring a three-cylinder motor, including the best-selling Ford 4000.

In the past seven-plus decades, Fendt has been the first with a CVT transmission, first with a multi-point suspension system and the first with full control of all drive functions and hydraulics via a single joystick. Even today, Fendt offers features that are unavailable at any price on other farm tractors.</p>\r\n<h3>Performances:</h3>\r\n<p>The Fendt 936 Vario broke all records in DLG PowerMix test and surpasses  the previous record held by the 828 Vario. Witha a fuel consumption of only 240 g/kWh, the high - horsepower tractor with Fendt  Efficient Technology sets a new benchmark.                                       The 240 g/kWh means 59 g/kWh of fuel are saved over the PowerMax average. That means  20% less diesel overall. The Fendt 936 Vario - best in its calss.</p>\r\n<h3>Engine: </h3>\r\n<table class=\" alignright\" style=\"height: 267px\" width=\"262\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_15342\" style=\"width: 235px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-15342\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2015/06/Engine.jpg\" alt=\"Fendt 900 Vario Engine\" width=\"235\" height=\"248\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fendt 900 Vario Engine</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong>Engine Fuel-efficient power</strong> -The rugged 7.8-liter, 6-cylinder turbocharged and air-to-air aftercooled Deutz engine, featuring four-valve technology, provides up to 300 PTO horsepower and up to 1,104 foot pounds of torque (936 Vario*). Renowned for its excellent fuel economy and quiet operation, this robust power plant incorporates the most advanced electronic engine control system available for peak performance. Part of the credit goes to the common-rail, high-pressure fuel injection system with injection pressures up to 29,008 PSI. Electronically controlled injection timing and volume that is independent of piston stroke further improves power and torque characteristics, as well as fuel economy and emissions quality.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Breathe easy</strong> - Equipped with new Fendt SCR (selective catalytic reduction) technology, the 900 Series is a breath of fresh air, both literally and financially. Not only do these tractors meet all current Tier 4i emissions standards, but they provide up to 7% better fuel economy than their predecessors. Because the system treats the exhaust externally, there’s no need to recirculate exhaust gas back into the engine or force it through complex filters. Instead, diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), which consists of urea in a purified water solution, is injected into an SCR catalyst in the exhaust system where it reacts with heat to reduce nitrogen oxide to harmless nitrates and water vapor. This means the engine can be tuned for peak performance and power, rather than emissions control.</p>\r\n<h3>Technical specifications:</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Engine:
