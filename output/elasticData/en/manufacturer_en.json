At the end of the 1950s, the company expanded its product range to hydraulic and industrial trucks. Up until the year 1969, LINDE Material Handling Ltd. produced <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\">tractors</a></strong> and diesel engines, and afterwards the production was completely set up. In the following decade, LINDE Germany concentrated its business on overtaking the Europe-wide companies who have specialised their production on construction and forklifts. In the middle of the 1980s, a new range of forklifts revolutionised the worldwide production of forklifts; the 351 Range was the best both in terms of design and capacity, and became a successful forklift worldwide. Today, LINDE is a part of the KION group. The former LINDE company produced more than 500,000 forklifts and brought a new storage technology concept vehicle onto the market.</p>\r\n<table style=\"background-color: #ffffff\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25254\" style=\"width: 297px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-25254\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/LINDE-electric-reach-truck.jpg\" alt=\"LINDE electric reach truck\" width=\"297\" height=\"260\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">LINDE electric reach truck</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td> <br />\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25251\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25251\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/LINDE-rder-picker-300x202.jpg\" alt=\"LINDE order picker\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">LINDE order picker</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td> <br />\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25250\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25250\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/LINDE-LPG-forklift-300x217.jpg\" alt=\"LINDE LPG forklift\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">LINDE LPG forklift</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h2>LINDE Products &amp; Machines</h2>\r\n<p>In LINDE's product portfolio, namely LINDE material handling equipment you could find: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>LINDE <a href=\"//trademachines.com/forklifts\">forklifts</a></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/electric-forklift\">Electric forklifts</a></strong></strong> </li>\r\n<li><strong><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/lpg-forklift\">Natural gas forklifts</a></strong></strong></li>\r\n<li>Commissioner – <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/high-lift-pallet-trucks\">lift trucks</a></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are also several different solutions available that are orientated towards special customer requirements.

In the next decade the factory expanded to include more industrial halls and was located where the current city hall is for 100 years. In 1976, the company moved to the Gildemeisterstraße. In March 2009, GILDEMEISTER signed a corporation agreement with the machine tool manufacturer, Mori Seiki Co. Ltd (based in Nagoya, Japan). This was responsible for production, sales, procurement, service, research and development, as well as making customer financing available worldwide. In 2013 MORI SEIKI and GILDEMEISTER signed an agreement to change their names to something more suitable. GILDEMEISTER Aktiengesellschaft became the DMG Mori Seiki Ltd., and since them Mori Seiki has been called DMG Mori Seiki Company Ltd.</p>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_15113\" style=\"width: 290px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-15113 size-full\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/Gildemeister_office.jpg\" alt=\"hans gildemeister\" width=\"290\" height=\"210\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">GILDEMEISTER main offices in Bielefeld</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>Areas of operation of GILDEMEISTER AG</h2>\r\n<p>Their area of machine tool production includes the following product lines: milling; turning and ultrasonic/laser technology; the Ecoline; and an electronics series.

This company has been successful on the international market for more than 15 years. A milestone in the companies history was in 1973, when GEHL Europe GmbH was founded in Neuenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, as a 100% subsidiary company. <strong>This maintains a broad inventory of machines, accessories and spare parts</strong>, thanks to the comprehensive service that GEHL Company provides its customers. Since the end of the 1970s, GEHL was mainly working in the construction machine sector. Today, the company produces complete product ranges, that are tailored to the individual needs of the market. This also includes niche products like track dumpers and compact articulated loaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Used GHEL Loaders for Sale are a Good Deal</h2>\r\n<p>GHEL tracked loaders, compact excavators, telescopic handlers and many more, are being manufactured with the most strict standards. Each of these machines can endure long hours and heavy duty work space, they are build especially for that reason. Thus making used GEHL machines a valuable purchase. Usually these machine cost a lot of money and for small business it might be out of reach.

He founded the YALE Lock manufacturing Company with Henry Towne, which transformed into the <strong>YALE and Towne Manufacturing Co.</strong> This company expanded its product range to include industrial trucks in 1875. In 1920, this company brought an electric low-platform truck onto the market, which was followed by <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\">tractors </a></strong>and stackers with forks. The 1930s saw their international breakthrough, when YALE established itself in England, took over the German company “BKS Forklifts”, and expanded their facilities to Japan. <strong>YALE Materials Handling expanded their product range</strong> significantly in the following years through various forms of innovation e.g. power steering and the use of heat isolation for electric motors. Their merge with Eaton Manufacturing in 1963 turned into the Industrial Truck Division of Eaton, <strong>Yale &amp; Towne</strong> <strong>Inc.</strong> which was later re-branded as the <strong>Eaton Corporation</strong> and was very successful internationally. Further strategic acquisitions, excellent research and development, and its global network puts this company in the leading position for producing industrial and commercial trucks and vehicles. In 2012, a spin-off company, NACCO Industries Inc. was formed from the <strong>Hyster YALE AG</strong>, was listed in the U.S. stock market and became a parent company of the YALE Materials Handling Corporation.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>YALE Forklifts is The Focus of The Business</h3>\r\n<p>As an excellent specialist for forklifts , the <strong>YALE Materials Handling Corporation</strong> focuses on the development and manufacturing of forklifts and lift trucks of various dimensions and for different applications. They are available with electric, gas or diesel motors. Commissioners and tractors round off their product range.

The 1970s were characterised by further developments including electronic steering for the electric forklift, the first off-road forklift and the new reach truck. When CESAB GmbH was founded in Germany in 1982, they were able to expand across Europe. This was initiated through the development of CESAB's heavy duty electric forklift and their storage forklift range. Further branches in Great Britain and France followed. The Blitz and Drago models were introduced and immediately given awards.

Yanmar built a name for themselves through the production of ship engines and fuel injections for diesel engines in the years following the war. In the 1950s, diesel engine technologies were constantly developed and also awarded by the German Investors Association.

Now, with more than 3000 employees the company has become a leader in the power generation industry.</p>\r\n<h3>About FG WILSON Generators </h3>\r\n<p>Founded by Fred Wilson in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the company grew in the 1970’s with its investments in the Middle East, and in 1977, FG WILSON purchased its first electrical manufacturing plant. The company’s most popular product, the small capacity generator, had an exponential rise in the 1980’s. In 1981, FG WILSON engineering ltd opened another production facility in Newtonabbey, Northern Ireland. By the 1990’s the company had offices in Germany, France, Spain, Hong Kong, Russia, Australia, South Africa, North America, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore. With offices around the world, the company’s sales drastically increased and FGWILSON became the leader in the industry of power generators. In 1999, FG WILSON became the world’s largest generator set manufacturers when it was purchased by  <a href=\"//trademachines.com/manufacturer/caterpillar\"><strong>CATERPILLAR Inc</strong></a>. and became a subsidiary to the construction and mining equipment giant.</p>\r\n<h2>FG Wilson - Expert in power generation</h2>\r\n<p>FG WILSON Engineering FZE produces <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/generators\">generators</a> </strong>according to the strictest guidelines offered by the UK government. This has made them an internationally recognized brand, which is owing to the high standards of the organization itself. Users will find that these generator models are reliable and efficient in many ways. This has added to the performance that people can expect to get. These generator sets are distributed to users across the globe as well. FG WILSON engineering ltd also provides an extensive amount of local support, which has helped users understand what the brand has to offer to them. It has been built to a global standard that is largely unmatched by many other brand names out on the market. This is why these generators have seen use in industries that are as diverse as healthcare, <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/construction\">construction</a> </strong>and data centers. FG WILSON Engineering FZE does provide end to end service for the products that they send out to the market.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The company actually produces a wide range of gas and diesel generator sets. The output range of these sets will tend to vary from between 5.5 to 2500 kVA. It does tend to provide a lot of reliable power, since these units can stand up to the test. Each of these models have been engineered to offer support for a wide range of different projects. The company does maintain a global supply network, which FGWILSON will use to deliver their generator units on time to almost any home. The reliability of these generators has been tested and approved by different rating agencies. Transportation for these generators can be made available for owners that are situated in remote locations.</p>\r\n<table style=\"background-color: #ffffff\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26680\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26680\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/06/FG-WILSON-acustic-enclosure-300x278.jpg\" alt=\"FG WILSON acoustic enclosure\" width=\"300\" height=\"278\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">FG WILSON acoustic enclosure</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26681\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26681\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/06/FG-WILSON-generator-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"FG WILSON generator\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">FG WILSON generator</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26683\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26683\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/06/Transfer-panel-by-FG-WILSON-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Transfer panel by FG WILSON\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transfer panel by FG WILSON</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>"},{"id":"2113_en","content":"<table class=\" alignright\" style=\"height: 199px;background-color: #e6e6e8\" width=\"250\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<table class=\" aligncenter\" style=\"height: 250px\" width=\"240\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>     </td>\r\n<td> \r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15988\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/EINHELL-logo-300x110.jpg\" alt=\"EINHELL logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"110\" /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Founded in  1964</li>\r\n<li>Located in Bavaria</li>\r\n<li>Specialty: Garden machinery and woodworking</li>\r\n<li> <strong>Website: <a href=\"http://www.einhell.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">einhell.com</a></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>    </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-15994\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/einhall-quality.jpg\" alt=\"einhall quality\" width=\"82\" height=\"78\" /></p>\r\n<p>EINHELL Tools is the leading German manufacturer of garden products, chainsaws and tools for home and professional use.

It was only in the years to follow that the company also manufactured tools and garden products, such as battery chargers and welding equipment. In the mid-1970s, EINHELL Bavaria extended its production to a plant in Spain and in 1987 it was listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the name Hans EINHELL AG. The advancing globalization allowed EINHELL to further expand its production to Asia. This is also the reason why EINHELL can provide high-quality tools with an effective price advantage of 30 – 50 percent compared to other high-quality producers in the same sector. The successful development and distribution of its products continuously allows the formation of increasing numbers of subsidiaries in other countries. Since 2008 the company is registered as EINHELL Germany AG and it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014 with the introduction of the innovative product range Power X-Change, a one-battery-fits all system for power tools and <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/garden-and-urban-equipment\">garden products</a></strong>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15997\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/EINHELL-germany.jpg\" alt=\"EINHELL germany\" width=\"792\" height=\"263\" /></p>\r\n<h2>EINHELL Tools &amp; Products</h2>\r\n<p>EINHELL has more than 1,400 employees worldwide working with a product range of approximately 3,500 items of high quality at affordable prices.

The task was to develop applications for the automation and rationalization of production processes. It was in this regard that at the end of that same decade the FLADDER® Sanding System was introduced, followed by innovative abrasive blades. It was an innovation in the sector providing a grinding quality that had never before been achieved. From then on FLADDER continued to patent its innovations and quickly became a global leader in sanding and deburring systems. The 1980's brought the beginning of automation which greatly contributed to sales and the growth of the company. As FLADDER gains more and more renown on the global market, a new word begins to describe plate deburring among technicians and engineers: Fladdering. Patenting its innovations serves a twofold purpose, on the one hand patents can protect the idea and further improvements and on the other hand they spur on developments in new application fields.

The firm was founded in 1987 in the Canadian city of Waterloo, Ontario. By 1992 the company had expanded so quickly that another manufacturing plant was required in the city of Fredericton, New Brunswick. This was followed by the opening of a major sales and service centre in Cambridge, Ontario as URBAN MACHINERY began to supply customers across North America. In 1996, the firm made a huge step forward by opening a subsidiary in the state of Oregon in the United States, and the factories in Canada were steadily expanded to meet constant demand. By the year 2000, URBAN MACHINERY's window manufacturing machinery was regularly winning industry awards such as the Crystal Achievement Award for the firm's corner cleaning machinery and its automated welding lines. In 2007, after 20 years of operation, URBAN MACHINERY had opened new factories in Canada and Washington State, and had also started an operation in the Texan city of Dallas. With its broad range of assembly and production machinery, the firm can offer clients a full suite of production equipment, allowing them to start production of windows almost immediately after installation. This includes a number of innovative automation solutions, such as automatic screw feed units and automatic screwing machines, which have been making window production cheaper and safer since their introduction.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the TOS company began a period of reconstruction in what become the Czech Republic. TOS a.s. developed a table type milling and boring machine that received a gold medal at an International Engineering Fair.

By 1950, production had exceeded one-million units and its products were available around the world. <strong>TRUMPF's</strong> second factory was opened later in the decade and a key patent followed in 1957: a coordinate guidance system for metal sheets. Expansion in the use of <strong>TRUMPF laser technology</strong> came with a shareholding in the Haas-Laser company. A decade later came another important advance when the world's first <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/sheet-metal-working\">sheet metal fabrication machine</a></strong> with a numerical control system was unveiled at the European Machine Tool Exhibition in Paris, causing a sensation because of its pioneering computerised operation, which set the stage for the TRUMPF machinery makes today. TRUMPF's research into lasers led it to produce the company's first punching-laser machine in 1979, and it was an immediate success. A specialist laser factory is now part of the TRUMPF factory campus at Ditzingen near Stuttgart, and there are subsidiaries around the world, including in Japan and the United States.

From the start, MAGGI Company placed great emphasis on the high quality of its machines, produced by a team of expert staff and technicians. The main markets for MAGGI Engineering's products are in both the handcraft and industrial industries. The initial range gradually expanded over the decades from the original line of automatic feeders and included first radial arm saws and later the latest line of multiple boring machines. MAGGI Engineering believes now that it is one of the leading producers of boring machines in the world. Some 85% of the output of the MAGGI Products factory in Tuscany is exported, with markets in some 80 countries.

The firm was founded by brothers Eugen and Martin HILTI in 1941, when wartime requirements meant that power tools were in high demand. In the first ten years of its operation, the firm made a name by supplying tools for the textile industry and car manufacturing operations in nearby Germany, but it was in the 1950s that HILTI hit its stride, introducing its signature range of high-velocity tools. At this stage, the firm expanded into the Italian market and rebuilt its workshop into a modern factory in the town of Schaan. New products followed during the 1960s, including rotary hammer drills, and the firm began investing consistently in research and development. HILTI also continued to specialize in powder-actuated tools (PAT), an area that it was steadily taking as its own. Success continued into the 1970s, when plants were opened in Austria and Germany, and the 80s saw even more new products, including chisel hammers and diamond drilling systems, as well as a new manufacturing facility in Hungary.</p>\r\n<h2>HILTI AG New Areas of Technology</h2>\r\n<p>HILTI became a true global corporation in the 1990s with the establishment of a factory in China and investment in state of the art technology such as laser positioning systems. The firm's equipment started to be used widely in the <a href=\"//trademachines.com/wood\">woodworking industry</a>, and HILTI also became one of the first power tools manufacturers to experiment with web-based sales and service. This growth and development continued during the 2000s, with more plants opening in Mexico and China, as well as beneficial deals with firms like Panasonic to produce cordless screwdrivers. HILTI also developed new heavy duty technology, such as heavy demolition breakers and combihammers, and the firm also began investing in renewable energy technologies with a move into solar mounting platforms in 2010. Within this impressive story of development, HILTI has remained anchored in family traditions and the community of Schaan, although it has created a workforce some 21,000 strong across the world. Sales and research are effectively globalised, with technicians providing support and selling HILTI products on all continents.</p>\r\n<h2>Used HILTI Power Tools</h2>\r\n<p>HILTI's power tools are used across the world by large engineering companies in sectors such as construction, furniture making, aerospace, automobile manufacturing and ship-building, but are also popular with small tradesmen and workshops. They offer specialist equipment to the renewable energy sector, and bespoke diamond drilling services as well. Every company who needs HILTI machines has another option of purchesing their machines.

First produced in 1941, JEEP's are the oldest off-road vehicles still in production, and gained fame for their association with the American army during World War Two and beyond. After the war, JEEP focused on manufacturing off road vehicles for commercial and private applications, including technologically advanced models which had the capability to traverse river beds. This kind of rugged quality made them popular as business vehicles for companies working in hard to access terrain such as mining firms, quarries, oil and gas exploration and agricultural businesses.

This brought together vehicle manufacturing expertise from across Europe into one consolidated industrial organization, allowing IVECO to expand across the world. The merger also allowed IVECO to launch with a huge range of vehicles on offer. By 1979, the product range included 200 models, from light vehicles to heavy trucks. Some of these, including the instantly popular Daily range of light vans, were introduced in the years after IVECO's formation, as the brand began to generate a reputation for ease of use and reliability. This was enhanced during the 1980s, when IVECO adopted a strategy of boosting its international image via sporting sponsorship (and was one of the first major companies to do so).</p><h2>Expanding into fire-fighting and passenger transport vehicles</h2><p> \tInnovation also continued, with the introduction of the world's first direct injection light diesel engine in 1985.

In 1839 the Bizer Brothers received their first commission, to build a weighbridge for Balingen. BIZERBA went on to produce <strong>innovative equipment</strong> that would help to make slicing, processing, weighing, cashing and the checking of groceries more efficient.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In 1868 Andreas Bizer registered A. Bizer, Manufacturer of Weighbridges, as a small company. Andreas Bizer's son in law, Whilhelm Kraut, the then manager of the company, collaborated with master craftsmen Schlaich and Hauser, to create the world's very first pendulum quadrant weighing scales, in 1924. The scales were patented in 1930 by <strong>BIZERBA GmbH</strong>. Ever innovative, BIZERBA went on to design and produce the world's first industrial scale. The company brought its expertise to retail and grocery stores in 1965, with electronic measuring weights and pricing equipment. In 2002 BIZERBA were again the first to introduce CE glass touch screen scales. This revolutionised updating and scale management. Optical Article Recognition Scales were introduced in 2007 and in 2010 BIZERBA produced a new Ceraclean surface to their existing BIZERBA slicers.</p>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">BIZERBA Product Portfolio</h2>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify\">\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/hand-machines\">Slicers</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Retail scales</li>\r\n<li>Meat processing machines</li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/measuring-equipment\">Industrial weighing systems</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Labeller</li>\r\n<li>Labels &amp; Consumables</li>\r\n<li>Software</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>BIZERBA</strong> design and produce a range of food processing and handling equipment, like Slicers, Meat Processing Machines, Retail Scales and Industrial Weighing Systems.

In the post-war decades WEEKE GmbH prospered, supplying machinery to such factories and expanding its operations. It also innovated, introducing significant advances into wood working processes, such as producing the first lock insertion machine and through-feed drilling - both of which have become standard in modern wood processing. The WEEKE family sold the firm in 1986, as it was included in the Homag group, although WEEKE Bohrsysteme GmbH retained its own identity and function, even adding sanding technology to its repertoire with the acquisition of Butfering in 2012. This meant that the firm now included four main areas of expertise: drilling, sanding, <a href=\"//trademachines.com/cnc-working-centers\"><strong>CNC technology</strong></a> and assembly. It has created a worldwide sales network, and distributes its technology in over 70 countries - a testament to the enduring demand for its wood working expertise.

At first his business was repairing electric motors. He fast moved on to manufacturing them. Generators were at first at the heart of the company's portfolio. Post-war, STILL introduced its first <strong>electrically-powered</strong> forklifts. German, Italian and Japanese railways ordered 100s of STILL forklifts and electric trolleys in the 1950s, allowing STILL to gain in strength. In 1969, the manufacture of electrical machinery was stopped, with the focus now entirely on the manufacture of industrial vehicles, always aiming at innovation for its customers. By the 1970s, the first fully-automated machines were installed on the STILL production line, while employees were offered flexible working hours. STILL GmbH was one of the first in its field to meet California emissions requirements with its products. In the 1980s, STILL introduced the first hybrid drive industrial truck. STILL Germany continued to expand, and in 1989, for instance, bought the French Saxby concern. The fall of the Berlin wall led to expansion into eastern Europe and in the 2000s, a multi-million euro investment programme in new manufacturing facilities. STILL today says it focuses on innovative and intelligent ideas, always with an eye on the environment.</p>\r\n<table style=\"background-color: #ffffff\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25207\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25207\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/STILL-EXU-H-low-lift-pallet-truck-300x268.jpg\" alt=\"STILL EXU-H low lift pallet truck\" width=\"300\" height=\"268\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">STILL EXU-H low lift pallet truck</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25208\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25208\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/STILL-RC-40-Diesel-and-LPG-forklift-300x278.jpg\" alt=\"STILL RC 40 Diesel and LPG forklift\" width=\"300\" height=\"278\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">STILL RC 40 Diesel and LPG forklift</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25209\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25209\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/STILL-RX-50-Electric-Forklift-300x277.jpg\" alt=\"STILL RX 50 Electric Forklift\" width=\"300\" height=\"277\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">STILL RX 50 Electric Forklift</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h3>Examples for STILL Material Handling Products</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/electric-forklift\">Electronic forklift trucks</a></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/lpg-forklift\">LPG</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/diesel-forklift\">Diesel forklift trucks</a></strong></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"//trademachines.com/warehouse-machinery\"><strong>Warehouse material handling equipment</strong></a></li>\r\n<li>Platform trucks </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d603770.6484753819!2d-3.2140398185339927!3d53.76315790202567!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x7ffb79b722fadbe5!2sSTILL+Materials+Handling+Ltd!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1448443761179\" width=\"1100\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>"},{"id":"2242_en","content":"<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-14465\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/07/Weiler-300x133.jpg\" alt=\"weiler\" width=\"300\" height=\"133\" />The German company WEILER is based near Nuremberg and is a world leader in the manufacturing of engine and cycle-controlled <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/lathes\">lathes</a></strong>.

Technically detailed solutions are also available. The machines can be controlled either conventionally or through contouring control and they possess outstanding torques already at low engine speed. Even though the machines are massive cast constructions made of high-quality material, they provide high-precision working even when heavy-duty machining. The company's milling machines are leading the market in regards to compact constructions with simultaneously high output reserves. In addition, compact machines such as the horizonal &amp; vertical bed-type milling machines are very versatile and extremely torsion-resistant. Because of solid and well-engineered constructions as well as material profiles it is possible to achieve highest precision. One milling spindle generates 7.5 to 25 kilowatt power. The vertical movement of the bed-type milling machine - carried out by the milling unit and the machine post - produces a high resilience of the router table for machining of even very large items. Since bed-type milling machines at RECKERMANN Fräsmaschinen possess two separately driven milling spindles it is not necessary to rechuck the workpiece, an otherwise time-consuming aspect of working with common milling machines.

Along with its metals business, the firm produces machinery and vehicles and delivers environmental and welding services.</p>\r\n<h2>A Century of Metal Manufacturing and Industrial Expansion</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">KOBELCO was founded in 1905 through the merger of the trading company Suzkuki Shoten with steel firm Kobayashi Seikosho. Initially the firm focused on steel production, but the 1930s saw KOBELCO launch cement manufacturing operations, and the production of electric mining shovels. Metal production continued after the war, and KOBELCO pioneered the production of titanium in Japan. During this period, he firm became an industrial giant with interests in steel and non-ferrous metals production as well as industrial machinery. International expansion followed, with an American subsidiary KOBELCO USA opening in 1960 and the opening of a fertiliser plant in Bangladesh. By 1980, the firm had operations across Asia, the Middle East and North America. The 1995 Kobe earthquake set the firm back, but it responded by expanding into power production and focusing on international production, meaning that by the firm's centenary celebrations, the future looked bright. Nowadays, KOBELCO's major industrial activities involve steel production, where the firm seeks to drive up productivity in line with global competition. But the firm also offers a thriving welding service and manufactures aluminium and copper products as well.

AEG (Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft) first started producing electric tools in 1898, when the firm created the first mobile drilling device. However, the firm has its roots in its parent company, which was formed by Emil Rathenau in 1883. Under Rathenau's stewardship, AEG became one of the world's largest manufacturers of electric tools and one of Europe's great engineering firms, building everything from ocean liners to planes and railways. The challenges posed by taking on such tasks meant that AEG developed its own tool manufacturing subsidiary. Initially designed for in-house use, products like the mobile drill became global best-sellers for their adaptability and quality. </p> <h2>From in-house workshop to world-class tool manufacturer</h2> <p> \tDuring the twentieth century, AEG marched on, introducing radical new ways of manufacturing its tools and bringing together the world of modernist art with the factory. The firm's beautiful, effective tools and factories became symbols of industrial progress. With tool manufacturing booming, the 1930s saw AEG set up a dedicated tool factory in the German town of Winnenden, and the company rapidly expanded its portfolio of products, introducing innovations like insulated drills and straight grinders. By the 1960s, the Winnenden plant allowed AEG Electric Tools to manufacture 20,000 tools per day, supplying the booming German economy. Technologies continued to be introduced as well, with AEG pioneering the production of micro-chip enhanced tools. In the 1980s, the firm expanded into the American market, with a modern production facility in the state of Connecticut. The tools branch also gained fame by producing a cordless screwdriver that was used by NASA astronauts, a sign of how forward-thinking AEG Electric Tools had become. During the 1990s, with AEG in general struggling, the tools manufacturing branch was sold to Swedish firm Copco, and then to TTI.

Ltd</strong>) goes back to post-war Japan in 1950, when two companies founded  <strong>IHI</strong> <strong>SHIBAURA</strong>. These companies were Toshiba (Tokyo-Shibaura-Engineering) and IHI (Ishikawajima Harima Industries). The original purpose of SHIBAURA was to make both light and heavy engines, and SHIBAURA today still retains a dedicated engine plant in the city of Matsumoto. Originally, all of <strong>SHIBAURA machinery</strong> were marketed under the Ishikawajima brand, which later became Ishikawajima-Harima, and then SHIBAURA Japan, the brand the company uses today. As those original engines proved successful, SHIBAURA began making its own tractors, equipped with SHIBAURA engines in 1961. SHIBAURA expanded quickly, and the company began making its first series of tractors over 50 hp in 1978.</p>\r\n<p>By then, <strong>IHI SHIBAURA </strong>also had a contract with Ford to make its Fordson tractors which were later marketed as the New Holland range. In 1990, came another supply and design agreement: this time with the Japanese firm Yanmar, which was followed by a more formal tie-up agreement with Yanmar in 1993 to produce the AF range of tractors. Europe had been catered for in 1991, with a supply and service company <strong>SHIBAURA Europe BV</strong>, being established in the Netherlands. China was SHIBAURA's next target, and a joint venture with the world-leading Perkins diesel engine company, Perkins SHIBAURA Engines (Wuxi) Company Limited in 2008. By then, SHIBAURA had adopted the name IHI SHIBAURA Machinery Corporation name, turning the 'Ishikawajima' part of its name into IHI, simpler for non-Japanese business users to say and understand. <strong>SHIBAURA machinery </strong>is now produced in four owned factories in Japan. Along with the dedicated engine plant at Matsumoto, there is a tractor plant in the same city which covers a massive 35 acres. A plant in Okayama covers an area of about 5 acres. The factory portfolio is completed with a specialist plant in Ashikaga which produces SHIBAURA machinery for golf courses as well as its front mowers. SHIBAURA Japan says that its global reputation is the result of manufacturing \"pure quality\" machinery.</p>\r\n<table style=\"background-color: #ffffff\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26791\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26791\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/IHI-SHIBAURA-Front-sit-on-Mower-300x266.jpg\" alt=\"IHI SHIBAURA Front sit on Mower\" width=\"300\" height=\"266\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">IHI SHIBAURA Front sit on Mower</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26792\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26792\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/IHI-SHIBAURA-slope-mower-300x272.jpg\" alt=\"IHI SHIBAURA slope mower\" width=\"300\" height=\"272\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">IHI SHIBAURA Slope mower</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26793\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26793\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/IHI-SHIBAURA-Tractor-300x235.jpg\" alt=\"IHI SHIBAURA Tractor\" width=\"300\" height=\"235\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">IHI SHIBAURA Tractor</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h3>Used IHI SHIBAURA Mowers</h3>\r\n<p>Shibaura garden equipment is known worldwide and considered of one of the most reliable and mowers manufacturers out there.

The company says it is a world leader in the field of road sweeping, with more than 200 distributors globally, and with JOHNSTON road <strong>sweeping machinery</strong> on duty daily in major cities from Moscow to New York.</p>\r\n<h2>A history of JOHNSTON Sweepers Ltd.</h2>\r\n<p>JM JOHNSTON and his two brothers were the pioneers of the company that we now know as JOHNSTON Sweepers Ltd. In 1904, in the heart of London, England, they began importing and distributed stone from Germany for use as a foundation for <a href=\"//trademachines.com/road-construction-machinery\">road construction</a>. By 1908, the brothers were making their first road oriented machine, designed for use in tarring roads. In just two years, it became the choice of town councils throughout Britain. After the First World War, refinement of its machinery continued, and in 1937 JOHNSTON produced the machine that is the direct ancestor of the core of the company's production today: the JOHNSTON Mobile Sweeper and Collector. In the 1950s, the company produced its first commercial JOHNSTON truck-mounted sweeper, after several prototypes had been produced.</p>\r\n<p>Launched at a public works exhibition, this machine was an immediate success and its introduction is regarded today as a real milestone in its field. By 1965, the company had 80% of the British market, and was already exporting. Demand was such, that in 1970, JOHNSTON built a new dedicated factory in Dorking, Surrey, where manufacture is still based today. The 1980s saw a compact sweeper range introduced, to meet the demands of keeping busy urban streets clean in an efficient manner. In 1995, the company delivered its 15,000th JOHNSTON Sweeper and a year later acquired a Danish company, Beam, which specializes in airport cleaning equipment. The acquisition of a Canadian company, MadVac, which manufactures litter collection systems, followed in 2000. Formally renamed JOHNSTON Sweepers Ltd. in 2003, the company continues to innovate and is regarded as one of the world leaders in street cleaning in urban areas. JOHNSTON Sweepers is now part of the giant German Bucher Group. JOHNSTON Sweepers, though, are still British-designed and made.</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26738\" style=\"width: 285px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-26738\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/Mid-size-sweeper-by-JOHNSTON-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Mid size sweeper by JOHNSTON\" width=\"285\" height=\"190\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mid size sweeper by JOHNSTON</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26740\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26740\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/JOHNSTON-Sub-Compact-sweeper-300x190.jpg\" alt=\"JOHNSTON Sub Compact sweeper\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">JOHNSTON Sub Compact sweeper</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26739\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26739\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/09/JOHNSTON-Truck-Mounted-Sweeper-300x190.jpg\" alt=\"JOHNSTON Truck Mounted Sweeper\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">JOHNSTON Truck Mounted Sweeper</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h2>JOHNSTON Sweepers Product portfolio</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sub Compact road sweepers</li>\r\n<li>Compact road sweepers</li>\r\n<li>Mid sized road sweepers</li>\r\n<li>Truck mounted road sweepers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>JOHNSTON Sweepers produces a class-leading range of street cleansing vehicles.

At that time, the company was founded in the Karolinenviertel in Hamburg under the name of HEIDENREICH &amp; HARBECK. The focus of production remained on&nbsp;<a href=\"//trademachines.com/lathes\">lathes</a> and engine lathes until the end of the First World War.</p><p> \tIn 1927, the company from Hamburg acquired an abandoned foundry in Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein, that had evolved from the foundry Burmester (found. 1859). Over the following decades, the foundry experienced a great economic boost and developed into one of the largest industrial enterprises in the city of Mölln.</p><p> \tHEIDENREICH &amp; HARBECK's factory in Hamburg had to greatly realign its production during the Second World War and then focused on the manufacture of artillery and guns. Later, in the 1950's, the company had not only made its name as a trend-setting enterprise for lathes in Europe, but - together with ZEISS Jena - also received the offer to produce the mirror for the observatory in Hamburg in 1951. However, in 1972 the entire company had to be sold to GILDEMEISTER AG from Bielefeld. In hindsight, this was a lucky stroke for the foundry in Mölln, because it was at the end of the 1970's that it was converted into a GmbH (Ltd.). From that moment on, it was possible for the company to function as an independent subsidiary of GILDEMEISTER. That same year, the Japanese company MAKINO acquired the factory in Hamburg and the factory is still run under the name MAKINO GmbH today.</p><p> \tThe foundry in Mölln remained unaffected by all these developments. At the end of the 1980's it was entirely remodeled with the goal in mind to manufacture - for the first time in European history - cast parts up to 8 tonnes per piece. In 1993, HEIDENREICH &amp; HARBECK was bought up by GILDEMEISTER's manager Ernst du Maire. In 2002 followed the transformation into an AG (incorporated company) which brought about the abbreviation HUHAG (HEIDENREICH &amp; HARBECK AG). In the summer of 2012 the company came to face to face with bankruptcy and filed for insolvency. This development, however, led another company, LEIKO CAPITAL GmbH, to invest into the foundry for the long haul.

With the compound shutter, it was possible to produce and place the first invention of his company on the market. The split with Bruns led to the rebranding of the Friedrich DECKEL GmbH that registered renowned companies such as Carl Zeiss, Bausch &amp; Lomb as well as Alfred Gauthier as shareholders in 1910. For his innovations, DECKEL required precision machine tools that he himself developed and manufactured. This branch of his enterprise took on an even more important role in the company's structure as years went by. In the 1950's, the company achieved worldwide recognition with its milling machines. The Friedrich DECKEL Präzisionsmechanik und Maschinenbau KG (Friedrich DECKEL Precision Mechanics and Machine Engineering limited partnership) made it to the fourth rank among German mechanical engineers, so that it was possible to rebrand the company as Friedrich Deckel AG (Inc.) in 1972. The merger into the DECKEL Maho AG in 1993 was not successful and due to the bankruptcy the following year, the company ended up to be fully absorbed in what is known today as the DMG Mori Seiki corporation.

The company sells DUNLOP TIRES OR DUNLOP TYRES as one of its brands. The history of DUNLOP TYRES as it was initially called began in 1888. It all started with a veterinary surgeon's love for his young son. When John Dunlop saw his young son having a hard time to ride his tricycle, the surgeon made tyres of canvas that were bonded with liquid rubber. These pneumatic tyres were used by Willie Hume to win a number of cycling races the following years. In 1922, DUNLOP's very first tyre using canvas casing and steel rods was introduced. This tyre had service life which was equivalent to three times the tyres that existed then. The year 1923 marked the debut of DUNLOP into the world of motor racing, a starting point that saw scores of prestigious motor racing victories over the years. To solve the problem of high speed on a wet road which makes tyres lose grip easily, the world's first aquaplaning tyre was introduced in 1962. The supreme performance and technology of DUNLOP came into prominence with DUNLOP's win of the very first ever London to Sydney Marathon in 1968. Spanning over 16,000 kilometres, three continents, Asia, Europe and Australia were covered during this marathon. The introduction of Warnair in 1999 marked the entry of the world's first ever tyre with sensors for detecting tyre pressure loss. GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY's acquisition of DUNLOP did not stop the brand DUNLOP from expanding in any way. In 2007, Touch Technology tyres, which were the result of over 100 years of DUNLOP expertise, were introduced into the market. The year 2008 saw DUNLOP's strive for a more environmentally friendly world with the introduction of Ensave 97 tyres, which were made of 97 percent fossil-free materials.</p><h2>The DUNLOP product portfolio</h2><p> \tThe scope of products that are manufactured by DUNLOP includes:</p><ul> \t <li>Automotive tyres</li>\t <li>Competition go-cart tyres</li>\t <li>Commercial truck tyres</li>\t <li>Motorcycle tyres</li>\t <li>ATV or All-terrain vehicle tyres</li></ul><p> \tProducts that are manufactured by DUNLOP are used by consumers and world class motor sport drivers in various motor racing tournaments including the Grand Prix.

They tried to sell their cars a second time by placing their Datson 10 on the market. However, a hurricane destroyed their factory in 1931. With strategical acquisitions, the company was restructured and a lot of capital helped build the brand, Datsun, and a new facility in Yokohama (which is still where the head office is today). Commercial vehicles were not in high demand during the war, and so they replaced their production with airplane and ship engines. In 1947, they continued to produce vehicles and this was modernised through licensing. With the development of their forklift in 1957, <strong>NISSAN FORKLIFT</strong> was a milestone in the company's history. These forklifts were first developed for their own use, but in the 1970s they became so successful that they were exported to Europe. The NISSAN FORKLIFT GROUP produces their models in their own facilities in Spain, Japan, U.S.A. and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h2>NISSAN Areas of operation</h2>\r\n<p>NISSAN MOTOR COMPANY'S established knowledge of engines directly flowed into the development and production of their various forklifts. This is why the NISSAN FORKLIFT GROUP can provide so many <strong>differently dimensioned forklifts</strong> with electric or combustion engines. Additionally, this company also has machines and equipment for storage technology, like the commissioner and reach trucks. These are included in their world-wide portfolio. This company puts a lot of value on advanced technology and the reduction of emissions.</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25265\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25265\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/NISSAN-cushion-tire-lift-truck-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"NISSAN cushion tire lift truck\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NISSAN cushion tire lift truck</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25266\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25266\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/NISSAN-electric-forklift-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"NISSAN electric forklift\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NISSAN electric forklift</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25267\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25267\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/NISSAN-electric-reach-truck-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"NISSAN electric reach truck\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NISSAN electric reach truck</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_25269\" style=\"width: 225px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25269\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/NISSAN-walkie-stacker-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"NISSAN walkie stacker\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NISSAN walkie stacker</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>NISSAN Product portfolio</h2>\r\n<p>NISSAN portfplio is very big, wide and diverse. here are some examples for what NISSAN can offer as a new machine or as a used NISSAN machinery:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/electric-forklift\">Electric forklifts</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Forklifts with a combustion engine</li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/high-reach-forklifts\">Reach trucks</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Commissioners</li>\r\n<li>Electric low-platform trucks</li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/high-lift-pallet-trucks\">Electric high-lift trucks</a></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d389632.457883261!2d-88.31497011244265!3d42.16426447999622!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xad790e4bd8507040!2sUniCarriers+Americas+Corporation!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1448525169358\" width=\"1100\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>"},{"id":"2005_en","content":"<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-25291\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/04/Yamazaki-MAZAK-Logo-300x85.jpg\" alt=\"Yamazaki MAZAK Logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"85\" />The Yamazaki <strong>MAZAK Deutschland GmbH</strong> (Mazak Germany) is a subsidiary company of Yamazaki MAZAK corporation form Japan.

Based in the town of Obernkirchen, ITT BORNEMANN made a huge breakthrough in 1934 when the firm was the first in the world to patent a twin screw pump. This innovation was built upon in the 1950s and 60s when the company introduced three screw pumps and progressive cavity pumps, which were instantly popular with chemical manufacturers and oil and gas firms across Europe. Despite this international success, the company has a strong sense of tradition and continues to be family owned. This is demonstrated by the BORNEMANN GmbH museum, a reconstruction of the locksmith's shop owned by the family from 1816.</p>\r\n<h2>An oil and gas supplier with a strong focus on environmental protection</h2>\r\n<p>The modern company is far removed from its ancestors, however, and manufactures its pumping products at a state of the art facility in the town of Gelldorf where it employs 400 people and records annual turnover of around 100 million Euros. ITT BORNEMANN Inc. has become a world leader in twin screw pumps, and expanded during the twentieth century in step with the growth of the fossil fuels industry. Wherever oil and gas was extracted from the earth's crust, BORNEMANN ITT pumping systems were employed to ensure that the process was achieved efficiently and safely. This led the firm to operate across the world, with subsidiaries in the USA, Europe and east and central Asia. Recent years have seen significant changes in the company's philosophy and operations, with a closer focus on environmental sustainability. The firm has also kept to a rigorous code of conduct in dealing with overseas clients, including a close attention to ensuring that corrupt practices are avoided. This has helped to position ITT BORNEMANN as a leading supplier to new oil and gas provinces, as well as the renewable energy industry.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d156007.31281232796!2d8.980867814725437!3d52.34114357799377!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x47ba796d3b247773%3A0x3b0aa6b754f1d369!2sITT+Bornemann+GmbH+-+Werk+1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1432296171427\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>ITT BORNEMANN GmbH Product Portfolio</h2>\r\n<p>The range of pumping products manufactured by ITT BORNEMANN includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Twin screw pumps (80 different sizes available)</li>\r\n<li>Multiphase boosting technology</li>\r\n<li>Progressive cavity pumps</li>\r\n<li>Subsea boosting technology</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The pumping technology manufactured by ITT BORNEMANN Inc is mainly provided to clients in the oil and gas extraction sector.

After World War Two, the company flourished, and increased employee numbers from around 150 in the 1930s to over 1,000 by 1960.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Creating one of the world's largest portfolios of power tools</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The product range also began to expand rapidly, with METABO introducing popular models of sander, electric hand grinders, and automatically controlled drills during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1969, the company had to expand into a new manufacturing facility in the town of Steinachwiesen, and international operations continued to expand as well. By 2010, METABO Group had created 24 overseas sales teams operating in 120 countries. The firm had also expanded to include 2,000 workers, with two production sites - one in Germany (at Nürtingen) and another in China. This growth was fuelled by constant demand for METABO's advanced power tools, which continued to innovate. In 2005, the firm introduced a light-weight and ultra-efficient range of lithium ion powered hand drills, while it consistently updated its cordless power tools to ensure that their mobility and ease of use was combined with power. The firm continues to place an emphasis on quality and manufacturing all components in-house.

The company’s name is composed of the German words “Hub” (“lift”) and “Textil” (“textile”). Also in 1981, the subsidiary HUBTEX of North America was founded. One year later HUBTEX moved from the Fulda district of Petersberg to the newly constructed headquarters in Fulda-West. In 1983 the European Council for Nuclear Research CERN in Geneva ordered an assembly machine for superconducting magnets weighing 8 tons from HUBTEX. In 1990 the Design Storage & Handling, Inc. in Fredericksburg, VA was founded by HUBTEX and the fork lift truck seller Rob Alling. Today, the Design Storage & Handling, Inc. is one of the leading companies for importing quality machinery into the USA and Canada. In 1992 HUBTEX introduced the joystick for proportionally controlled lift mast movements. In 1999 HUBTEX produced a transportation device for Skoda that was able to lift tools weighing 63 tons. Investments and acquisitions in the 2000s lead to the growth of HUBTEX. Between 1996 and 2012 the sales companies in France, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary and Brazil were founded. HUBTEX has about 250 employers.</p><h2>Main products</h2><p> \tHUBTEX produces customized vehicles for the transport of heavy goods, like&nbsp;side&nbsp;loaders, highlifters and heavy-duty transporters.

Some years before, Emerson watched his son pulling diagonal patterns with coil spring into the family’s garden patches. Emerson used this coincident discovery as an inspiration for developing a coil packer. The idea was to put a coil behind an agricultural vehicle so the wheels would not destroy the soil. By 1957 FLEXI COIL had produced more than 4.000 coil packers. The air seeding systems developed by the company are used in more than 20 countries in the world. In 1999 the American Society of Agricultural Engineers honored the FlexControl task controller with an Outstanding Innovation Award. The machine monitors the sowing process and logs information like latitude and longitude of the field via GPS. Also, it tags items like big stones in the field. In 1997 the company New Holland purchased 35 percent of FLEXI COIL. In 2000 FLEXI COIL was bought completely by the company CNH Global which was formed by the merger of New Holland and Case Corporation short time before.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d185276.38210813704!2d-79.74023614955114!3d43.482650092922356!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x882b60e5118e637d%3A0x68683b13dc8e141e!2sCNH+Capital+Canada+Ltd!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1432294370968\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Main products</h2>\r\n<p>FLEXI-COIL is specialized in producing farming vehicles and tools.

KUHN SA was founded by Joseph KUHN in 1828, as a manufacturer of weighing scales. However, everything changed in the 1860s when the railways started to cross the French countryside. With farmers needing to increase their efficiency to feed a growing population, KUHN SA started to manufacture advanced farm machinery to meet the growing demand. Because of its location in the town of Saverne, the firm actually swapped identities, becoming German from the 1870s and then French again in 1918, which helped KUHN France to expand its operations, reaching farmers in both nations. After World War Two, the firm formed a successful<strong> partnership with Swiss manufacturer Bucher-Guyer,</strong> becoming a world leader in mechanized agriculture.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_15455\" style=\"width: 550px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-15455\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/Mounted-Gyrotedders-Kuhn-GF-422.jpg\" alt=\"Mounted Gyrotedders Kuhn GF 422\" width=\"550\" height=\"220\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mounted Gyrotedders Kuhn GF 422</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">By the 1970s, KUHN SA was regularly exporting to markets as far away as Australia and the United States, had opened up a new research and development centre and made several acquisitions such as the plough manufacturer Huard. During the 1990s, KUHN Farm Equipment opened up operations in Telford, England, as well as the American state of Tennessee and the town of Schopsdorf, near Berlin. This was part of a drive to become the world's foremost supplier of agricultural machinery, and was backed up by continuing successes like victory in the 2001 World Ploughing Championships. The 2000s saw the firm expand still further, acquiring firms with expertise in crop spraying as well as baling and wrapping, allowing KUHN SA to supply all aspects of agricultural operations. That period also saw the firm begin production operations outside France - as the company brought more American firms under its umbrella. By 2012, the company has factories in the United States, Belgium, Brazil and France, and was pursuing a company strategy based around customer satisfaction, employee growth, sustainability and continual development of new product lines.</p>\r\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_15456\" style=\"width: 550px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-15456\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/08/MULTI-MASTER-113-NSH-5-bodies.jpg\" alt=\"Kuhn MULTI-MASTER 113 NSH - 5  bodies\" width=\"550\" height=\"220\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kuhn MULTI-MASTER 113 NSH - 5 bodies</figcaption></figure></p>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left\">KUHN Farm Machines Portfolio</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The range of agricultural machinery and equipment  manufactured by KUHN SA includes:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left\">\r\n<li>Mounted reversible ploughs</li>\r\n<li>Semi-mounted reversible ploughs</li>\r\n<li>Disc harrows</li>\r\n<li>Deep working <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/cultivators\">cultivators</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Strip tillers</li>\r\n<li>Stubble cultivators</li>\r\n<li>Mechanical <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/seed-drillers\">seed drills</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Pneumatic seed drills</li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/fertiliser-spreaders\">Fertiliser spreaders</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Mounted and trailed <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/sprayers\">agricultural sprayers</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Hedge and grass cutters</li>\r\n<li>Salt and sand spreaders</li>\r\n<li>Rotary toppers</li>\r\n<li>Gyrotedders</li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/mowers\">Mowers</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Rakes</li>\r\n<li>High density and round balers</li>\r\n<li>Round and square bale wrappers</li>\r\n<li>Silage cutters and kuhn equipment</li>\r\n<li>Straw blowers and feeders</li>\r\n<li>TMR mixers</li>\r\n<li>Manure spreaders</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The range of products manufactured by KUHN Agricultural Equipment are specifically designed to be used in agricultural operations.

However, the 1960s saw the business take off, with the introduction of several core products, such as its motorised rollers and hand graders as the company benefited from the expansion of the Spanish road network during that decade. The firm then introduced other mainstays of its product portfolio, from their bitumen spraying trucks to tipping loaders, <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/vibratory-compactors\">compactors</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/dumper-trucks\">dumper trucks</a></strong>. This ensured that by the 1980s, LEBRERO was in position to provide the whole suite of road construction machinery to clients around the world, offering an all-in-one solution. The company is no longer family owned, as the Indian group Telcon has taken a 60 percent holding in LEBRERO - which provides the Spanish firm with access to markets across the world. The merger has seen LEBRERO graders and compactors being used in hundreds of building projects as the Indian economy rapidly expands. The firm maintains a rigorous quality control regime, priding itself on the quality of the materials and components that are found in their products. When these components do wear out or fail, Comoplesa LEBRERO SA operates a spare parts service, and is able to ship the required parts to distant markets from their storage facility in Zaragoza. The firm also operates a wide commercial network of dealerships and support staff, with offices in America, Spain, Portugal and France, as well as close links to Asia via Telcon.</p>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Comoplesa LEBRERO SA  Product Portfolio</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">LEBRERO manufactures the following line of products:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify\">\r\n<li>Single drum vibratory rollers</li>\r\n<li>Tandem vibratory rollers</li>\r\n<li>Combined vibratory rollers</li>\r\n<li>Pneumatic tyre rollers</li>\r\n<li>Walk behind rollers</li>\r\n<li>Reversible plates</li>\r\n<li>Rammers</li>\r\n<li>Linear plates</li>\r\n<li>Gravel spreaders</li>\r\n<li>Bitumen spraying tanks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">LEBRERO's products are mainly used in road construction projects where land must be flattened and the road surface has to be spread evenly.

With <strong>strategical acquisitions,</strong> CATERPILAR opened the <strong>industrial turbine</strong> and engine manufacturing markets. The acquisition of Perkins Engines in 1997 was a record in Caterpillar history, because at 1.3 billion US dollars, this was the most <strong>expensive acquisition</strong> the company had made. In 1998, a further<strong> engine manufacturer,</strong> Krupp Mak – a Kieler company, joined and now there are three company branches under the Kieler Engine centre. 2003 and 2004 saw the expansion of the brands Payhauler and The Unit Rig Terex company, that make diesel-electric dump trucks and the Swiss turbo machinery from Babcock Borsig. Since 2005, the <strong>telescopic loaders</strong> from <strong>JLG industries</strong> have been added to Caterpillar Equipment product range and through the acquisition of Bucyrus International, the company's expansion is definitely not over.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d191293.16196366152!2d-88.41463917428774!3d41.48356106967125!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x880e623686a30335%3A0x3319131ae631cc48!2sCaterpillar+Inc!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1435227172909\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h3>Main CATERPILLAR Equipment</h3>\r\n<p>CATERPILLAR has <strong>more than 150,000 employees</strong> working in the largest consumer markets.

Although they started off producing agricultural equipment, the HAMM brothers soon found that their speciality was in crafting heavy rollers for road-building projects. As the road system developed in Germany, their rollers became a common sight on construction projects, supplying the compaction that civil engineers required. Exports to other markets began to take off in the 1950s, with the post-war economic expansion, and customers from across the world sought out HAMM rollers, with their excellent handling and aesthetic appeal. As road technology changed, HAMM AG adapted newest technologies in the industry, bringing in oscillating rollers in the 1980s which could process more sensitive road materials. The firm even moved into new areas of production, launching a popular soil stabilizer in 1992 and merging with the larger Wirtgen Group of companies, giving HAMM market reach across the world. In the 2000s, <strong>HAMM Deutschland</strong> continued to innovate, developing new production facilities such as Europe's best equipped drum manufacturing plant, and their rollers continued to attract international awards for their quality. HAMM AG expanded to include tandem rollers, rubber wheel rollers and compact rollers, and the firm established itself as a world leader in its field. HAMM also invested heavily in new technologies, introducing the Hammtronic system into its rollers, which allows users to automate key functions, saving time and fuel in the process. HAMM has also perfected a range of different compaction techniques, such as vibrating and oscillation.

The firm was founded in 1928 by Hub van Doorne as an engineering and repair shop, but the firm quickly switched to concentrating on the production of sturdy freight trailers during the 1930s. The firm then gained success, delivering reliable vehicles to the Dutch army, before changing its name in 1948 to Van Doorne's Automobiel Fabriek. DAF was one of the most innovative manufacturers of buses and trucks in post-war Europe, pioneering slide-out engines, which made maintenance much easier. The firm focused on truck production from 1950, opening new production facilities and supplying armed forces across Europe with multi-purpose vehicles. This strategy was so successful that, by 1955,&nbsp;DAF Trucks&nbsp;had turned out its 10,000th chassis, and continued to innovate, introducing trucks with the highest load capacity available at that time. This resulted in some ground-breaking vehicles, such as the 2600 haulage truck, which has been dubbed the \"mother of international road haulage\" as well as new departures for the firm such as tipper chassis designs and cement mixers. During the 1970s,&nbsp;DAF Trucks&nbsp;introduced light-weight trucks, as well as diesel models, including the popular \"Supercontinental\" truck, which became a common vehicle on long-distance haulage routes. </p> <h2>Winning rallies and developing sustainable haulage systems</h2> <p> \tDuring the 1980s, DAF pushed the boundaries further, and regularly won the Paris-Dakar rally with its reliable trucks that could perform in even the most demanding situations. Its trucks continued to become more spacious, more powerful and remained as lightweight as possible, driving up efficiency. New models came on the market, such as the \"Euromaster\" in 1990. However, during the 1990s, the haulage market suffered, and DAF TRUCKS was acquired by haulage group PACCAR in 1996, securing its future. The firm weathered the storm and brought out new trucks as the 2000s arrived, with the LF class of truck winning the Truck of the Year award in 2002, while a new test centre was opened in 2008. 2010 saw DAF TRUCKS launching another first, with its range of hybrid trucks, and the firm expanded overseas, opening a Brazilian factory in 2013. </p> <form> \t </form> <h2>The DAF Trucks product portfolio</h2> <p> \tThe range of industrial vehicles manufactured by&nbsp;DAF Trucks&nbsp;includes: </p> <ul> \t<li>The Euro 6 range of haulage trucks (XF, CF and LF models)</li> \t<li>The Euro 5 range of haulage trucks (XF and CF models)</li> \t<li>Specialist trucks for the forestry and mining sectors</li> \t<li>PACCAR MX-11 and MX-13 engines</li> \t<li>Components for trucks, specialist vehicles and buses/coaches</li> </ul> <p> \tThee product manufactured by&nbsp;DAF Trucks&nbsp;are mainly used by long-distance haulage firms, but their specialist vehicles are also purchased by forestry,&nbsp; \t<a href=\"//trademachines.com/construction\">construction</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"//trademachines.com/mining\">mining</a> companies, while their engines are used in buses, coaches and military vehicles. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"2388_en","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The German firm <strong>BEMA</strong> is a family-run firm based in Saxony which manufactures robust sweeping and ploughing attachments for cleaning vehicles such as <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\">tractors</a></strong>, industrial <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/vehicles\">vehicles</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/loaders\">loaders</a></strong>.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Manufacturing sweeping and snow plough attachments since the 1980s</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">BEMA GmbH Maschinenfabrik is a leading manufacturer of street <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/sweepers\">sweepers</a> </strong>and <a href=\"//trademachines.com/snow-ploughs\"><strong>snow ploughs</strong></a>, and supplies environmental management organizations across Europe.

BRIDGESTONE Tire Co., Ltd. Was formed in 1931 by Shojiro Ishibashi, who translated his own name into English to come up with the company name. With vehicle sales booming in Japan, the firm quickly assumed a position as the country's leading tire manufacturer, and introduced innovations such as nylon and rayon tires during the 1950s. Further developments followed during the 1960s, with the opening of a new factory and research centre in Tokyo, as well as a corporate museum. The firm also opened international subsidiaries, with an operation in Thailand commencing in 1969 and an American arm opening in 1967. American expansion really accelerated when the company acquired American tire producer Firestone in 1988, which also brought BRIDGESTONE new production centres in South America and Europe, making the company a global player in the automotive industry. The 1990s saw BRIDGESTONE become a household name as the company began a well-known association with the Indianapolis 500 and Formula One racing. Then, the 2000s witnessed another key development, when BRIDGESTONE acquired the firm Bandag, which brought with it a tire retreading business and the capability to manufacture high quality products for industrial trucks and buses across the world.</p><h2>A product range that goes beyond vehicle tires</h2><p> \tBRIDGESTONE operates plants across the world, on every continent, with 14 alone in the United States and 11 dotted around Europe.

Other tractors with diesel engines were developed, like off-road crawlers. More factories were opened in 1956, which meant that their product range could easily be developed and expanded. In 1966, LAMBORGHINI Tractor was the first manufacturer that mass produced its tractors with a DC circuit. In the 1980s, the company introduced a new range of tractors with innovative characteristics, like a water-cooled engine.

His first machines, which where carving and copying machines, made the company's name globally, and completely changed the way woodcarving was practiced internationally. Multi-spindle drilling machines followed, as did copy milling machines, used largely in the 1970s clog-making industry. The company branched out into making special machines for making kitchen furniture as well as doors and specialised machines for making upholstered furniture. One of REICHENBACHER's proudest landmarks came in 1999 when, using the very latest technology, the ECO model was developed, used in one application, to make fibre-reinforced boards for the aeroplane industry. Corporate restructuring followed commercial success as the company became REICHENBACHER Hamuel GmbH, which then became part of the powerful Scherdel Group allowing it further resources for research, development and customer service. Clients now include some of the biggest names in the aviation and motor industries.</p>\r\n<h5>Website: <a href=\"http://www.reichenbacher.com/en/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">reichenbacher.com/en</a></h5>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d40773.537603493685!2d10.990087854219508!3d50.304132965034924!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x47a3cfd6bae0a345%3A0x26c67246f15c9cc!2sReichenbacher+Hamuel+GmbH!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1432290593755\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><br />\r\n<h2>REICHENBACHER Hamuel Product Portfolio</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/cnc-working-centers\">REICHENBACHER CNC machining centres</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Multi-spindle drilling machines </li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/top-spindle-milling-machine\">Top-spindle milling machines</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Automatic carving machines</li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/wood-saws\">Saw</a> </strong>and boring combination machines </li>\r\n<li>Eight-spindle copy milling machines</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"},{"id":"2214_en","content":"<p style=\"text-align: justify\">OKUMA is a Japanese corporation whose focus is on manufacturing precision tools such as OKUMA <a href=\"//trademachines.com/lathes\"><strong>lathes</strong></a> and <a href=\"//trademachines.com/grinding-machines\"><strong>grinders</strong></a>, along with high-tech controls and software for these equipment and machine tools.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">A Japanese firm which manufactures machine tools and controls</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The Japanese firm OKUMA was founded in the town of Nagoya in 1898 and specializes in the manufacture of machine tools, CNC controls and motors.

Although the firm initially worked on the production of transformers, expansion quickly followed, with the firm taking a significant role in the welding market after the war. FRONIUS also continued to develop new sources of electricity and superconductors, unveiling the world's first transistor-switched battery in 1981, which reduced the size of power sources considerably. This was applied to the firm's core welding business, and allowed FRONIUS to introduce quicker, more portable welding equipment during the 1980s. The company also expanded, with a facility in Turkey and new plants in the Ukraine and Czech Republic opening in the 1990s. At the same time, the company created a sales network with offices across Europe, and the firm expanded still further - introducing solar photovoltaics and battery charging systems to its product portfolio. This led to award winning products such as the firm's Solarix solar inverter, and to the Success through Research award from Austria's Industrial Research Promotion Fund. FRONIUS continued innovating into the new millennium, with the introduction of <a href=\"//trademachines.com/welding-machines\"><strong>laser welding machines</strong></a>, more powerful conventional welding systems and smaller solar inverters to be used in large power grids. The firm also opened its first sales facility in the USA, as the firm worked to integrate its energy experience into vehicle charging systems.

The firm was founded in 1948 by engineer Rudolf Maxein, and began life as RMF, a supplier of machinery to the agricultural and construction sectors. During the 1950s, attention shifted to producing forklift trucks, and the company developed a wide range of novel attachments for use with their trucks, making them much more adaptable than their competitors. Innovations pioneered by the ancestor company of M-FAHRZEUGBAU included shovels, block clamps and snow blades, as the firm focused on manufacturing&nbsp; \tall-terrain forklifts for demanding conditions. From the start, the company operated on an international scale, delivering vehicles to an Indonesian lead smelter in 1963. However, despite enjoying international success, since 1965 it has been based in Neuwied-Gladbach, where most production occurs. </p> <p> \tThe 1970s and 80s saw further innovations, with the firm introducing a range of compact forklift trucks,&nbsp; \t<a href=\"//trademachines.com/electric-forklift\">trucks with electric motors</a> and models with hydrostatic individual wheel drives as well. By 1988, RMF could offer a variety of industrial vehicles which included their trademark forklifts, but also flat bed trucks, cable drum transporters and specialist vehicles for foundries. RMF became M-FAHRZEUGBAU in 2012 following the financial crisis, but the merged company retained both RMF's production facilities, market position and 60 years of experience in manufacturing forklift trucks. Since the merger, the firm has consolidated its reputation for manufacturing durable, high quality vehicles, and has attracted clients in a range of sectors, from steel-making to construction and from concrete plants to glass makers. M-FAHRZEUGBAU has also continued to work closely with each client, delivering bespoke industrial solutions via consultations and customer support. </p>  <h2>The M-FAHRZEUGBAU product portfolio</h2> <p> \tThe range of industrial vehicles manufactured by M-FAHRZEUGBAU includes: </p> <ul> \t<li><a href=\"//trademachines.com/compact-forklifts\">Compact forklift trucks</a> for the transportation of heavy loads&nbsp;</li> \t<li>Flatbed industrial transportation vehicles&nbsp;</li> \t<li>Coil drum transporter trucks&nbsp;</li> \t<li><a href=\"//trademachines.com/telescopic-forklifts\">Telescopic forklift trucks</a> </li> \t<li>Trucks for use in metal foundries</li> </ul> <p> \tM-FAHRZEUGBAU works with a diverse group of clients.

NUSSBAUM then unveiled the world's first double&nbsp;<a href=\"//trademachines.com/scissorlifts\">scissors lift</a> in 1985, with its popular Jumbo range (selling 110,000 units by 2000). After this success, the company expanded its production facilities, opening new factories in Magdeburg and Leipzig between 1992 and 1994 alongside its older facility in Bordersweier. Further innovation followed this expansion, with the company introducing its revolutionary smart towers in 1997, which found instant favour with customers across Europe.</p><h2>Moving into the sheet metals business and all-in-one solutions</h2><p> \tIn 2004, NUSSBAUM made a significant move by opening its sheet metals business, and continued to innovate, winning industry awards for its axis measuring robots. A huge new logistics centre was opened in 2007, while the company developed new products for use in the maintenance of trains and new products were added to the firm's portfolio in the areas of tyres and power lifts. By 2012, the company had consolidated a position as a leading international provider of automobile and train maintenance equipment, but had remained a family owned operation. It employs around 1,200 people at seven German factories, and operates a global distribution and support network to bring in new customers. Recent developments have focused on providing all-in-one solutions such as the Car Satellite system, which mixes car servicing and petrol/gas provision in one platform, allowing customers to achieve more efficient vehicle maintenance.</p><form> \t </form><h2>The NUSSBAUM product portfolio</h2><p> \tThe range of products manufactured by NUSSBAUM includes:</p><ul> \t <li>Automotive lifts</li>\t <li>Brake and headlight testers</li>\t <li>Wheel aligners</li>\t <li>Wheel balancers</li>\t <li>Tyre changers</li>\t <li>Vehicle air conditioning units</li>\t <li>Car satellite servicing platforms</li>\t <li>Combi and uni car lifts</li>\t <li>Truck lifts</li>\t <li>Truck brake testing and wheel alignment services</li>\t <li>Hydraulic industrial equipment</li>\t <li><a href=\"//trademachines.com/sheet-metal-working\">Sheet metal machines</a></li>\t <li>Parking and displaying technology</li>\t <li>Public transport systems</li></ul><p> \tThe products manufactured by NUSSBAUM are used by many industrial clients.

At first, Fritz Studer built the first cylindrical grinding machine to be used in the company’s mechanical workshop. But once he realized the vast potential of this machine, Fritz unveiled his invention to the world and took the market by storm. It is no accident that this former mechanical workshop would develop into the industry leader that it is today. The pioneering spirit of that era can still be found in the STUDER AG product range today. STUDER develops and manufactures external and internal cylindrical grinders for work pieces that are small to medium in size. These grinders are typically used for single, small, or medium-sized productions for industries such as <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/further-machine-tools\">machine tooling</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/electronics-industry\">electronics</a></strong>, and tooling shops. STUDER AG also offers equipment that can produce precision parts for mass production, typically for the hydraulic or fuel injection industries. This equipment is capable of covering numerous complex applications with high flexibility, for both internal and external grinding applications. FRITZ STUDER AG is the industry leader for quality performance <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/grinding-machines\">grinders</a></strong> with a reasonable price tag. </p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d43725.437636332324!2d7.6278960339598205!3d46.76805306530733!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x478fb318c5134179%3A0x1f3c83b28b2edb92!2sFritz+Studer+AG!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1432623397977\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>STUDER Products Portfolio</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Conventional Cylindrical Grinding</li>\r\n<li>Universal Cylindrical Grinding</li>\r\n<li>Production Cylindrical Grinding</li>\r\n<li>Combination Cylindrical Grinding</li>\r\n<li>Internal Cylindrical Grinding</li>\r\n<li>Machine Software</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"2646_en","content":"<p> \tKYOCERA DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS or KYOCERA for short is an Australian based company, which was formed in Sydney, Australia in 1989 for manufacturing document solutions.

Frustrated with the bad performance of his vacuum cleaner, he set about making his very own vacuum cleaner in 1978. A visit to a local sawmill gave him the idea of using the same cyclone concept for a vacuum cleaner. After an astounding 5127 prototypes and over 15 years, the new bagless vacuum cleaner, DC01 was born. This happened after James Dyson set up his own company in the town of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, UK in June 1993. Within a period of merely 18 months, DC01 took the UK by storm, gaining place as UK's biggest selling vacuum cleaner. In October 2009, DYSON revolutionised heating and cooling technology with the release of fan heaters, which had a cooling and heating system. Using Air Multiplier Technology, fan heaters without any visible blades were released into the world market. Over the years with creativity and engineering as the key, DYSON has grown to become one of the global leaders in manufacturing vacuum cleaners, fan heaters, bladeless fans and hand dryers.

Arnberg, C.G. Cervin and F. Didron. Initially focusing on railroad construction and operation products, the company radically changed direction when Wallenberg sank a great deal of capital into the business after a recession in the 1880s. Under the direction of industrialist Oscar Lamm, the company diversified its production range to include locomotives, central heating and machine tools. Through a mix of necessity and active research, Nya Atlas (as it was then named) began producing its own pneumatic tools and air compressors at the turn of the 20th century, eventually selling them commercially. The early 20th century saw Atlas developing cleaner, more reliable diesel compressors. After catching up with its competitors’ air-cooled compressor technology, ATLASCOPCO led the way in 1967 by introducing screw compressors which produced oil-free compressed air.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the company followed industry trends by exploring the possibilities in electrically-powered tools. In this vein,<strong> ATLAS COPCO Group</strong> acquired the German toolmaker Atlas AEG Werkzeuge in 1994, two years before its highly successful Tensor S electrical nutrunner hit the market. ATLAS COPCO Corp led the way again in 1994 when it introduced <strong>speed-controlled compressors,</strong> providing major energy savings. In 2004, the group acquired Ingersoll-Rand Drilling Solutions, and in 2007 it added a road construction division after buying Dynapac.</p>\r\n<table style=\"background-color: #ffffff\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26727\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26727\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/Compact-tandem-roller-ATLAS-COPCO-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Compact tandem roller ATLAS COPCO\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Compact tandem roller ATLAS COPCO</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26725\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26725\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/ATLAS-COPCO-Low-pressure-compressors-300x211.jpg\" alt=\"ATLAS COPCO  Low pressure compressors\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ATLAS COPCO Low pressure compressors</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<figure id=\"attachment_26726\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-26726\" data-src=\"/assets/media/content/sites/2/2014/05/ATLAS-COPCO-Asphalt-floor-saw-300x203.jpg\" alt=\"ATLAS COPCO Asphalt floor saw\" width=\"300\" height=\"203\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ATLAS COPCO Asphalt floor saw</figcaption></figure>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>The focus of the business</h2>\r\n<p>ATLAS COPCO machinery is divided into four areas of focus.

With eight orders from different companies in 1918, this was the company's foundation for a whole individual production range. CLARK (CMHC) introduced the Truclift in 1920, which was equipped with hydraulics so it could move between two and five tonnes up and down. In 1923, the Duat (“do this, do that”), a three-wheeled hauler and it could pull 750kg was produced. This was the foundation for the first gasoline-powered forklift. Clarktor and Tructier were the precursors for the modern CLARK generation. In 1942, the first electric-operated forklift was developed, which can only undertake one shift at a time. Its production had to be postponed until 1945 because the government's requirements were a priority at this time. In the following years, CLARK Material Handling Company continued to develop their technologies and undertook some strategic acquisitions. This means that CLARK products like forklifts was able to establish itself not only in Europe, but also in Asia, Latin America and South America. Since 2004, this company has been represented by “CLARK Europe GmbH” in Europe. Their head office was in Duisburg at first, and then it moved to Mülheim an der Ruhr in 2007.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d404059.07015457173!2d126.77420476501969!3d37.70297429954507!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x357c9d4ce08176c1%3A0x9be8258a666b135d!2s202-1+Ojeong-dong%2C+Ojeong-gu%2C+Bucheon%2C+Gyeonggi-do%2C+South+Korea!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1436453239514\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Range of Services</h2>\r\n<p>The first forklifts were developed over the years into intelligent industrial trucks that were modern, safe and ergonomic with various different types of engines.

The “Niepenberg &amp; Co. GmbH” became part of the commercial register in 1922, as a steel goods factory that produced roll and razor blades. In 1936, the first welding transformers were produced in small pieces, and up until the 1950s their focus lay in international renowned razors. A new mile stone was reached in 1945, with the production of the first spot welding machine. At the beginning of the 1950s, <strong>DALEX</strong> entire production was transformed towards compact welding transformers. In 1952, the company was renamed and the brand DALEX was introduced. Strategic investments and acquisitions meant that DALEX <strong>lay the foundation for an extensive distribution network</strong> in the 1960s, and it advanced to become a market leader of standard welding machines. Innovative special welding machines strengthened their market position continuously in the following years, which meant that they were able to overcome the crisis between 2008 and 2010. Research and development are also of great importance, which meant that modern and high tech machines were produced and serviced.</p>\r\n<h5>Website: <a href=\"http://www.dalex.de/index.php?id=11&amp;L=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">dalex.de</a></h5>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d642753.237490778!2d8.014606674552114!3d51.0022024492478!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x47bea2be3b3c7035%3A0x65b000b35cc9c972!2sDALEX+Schwei%C3%9Fmaschinen+GmbH+%26+Co.+KG!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1432221410769\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h2>Range of services</h2>\r\n<p>DALEX Welding Technology has profound competencies in resistance welding, and the development and production of standard machines, <strong>special machines</strong>, <strong>robot tongs</strong> and most of all, their customer services.

It was founded in the town of Nogara near Verona in 1987, where it operates a 90,000 square metre facility and employs 120 workers. The firm's range of construction products includes loaders, truck based aerial platforms, forklift trucks, undercarriages and dumpers. These vehicles were initially developed to be used in the horticultural sector, where large amounts of earth moving was required. Since its founding, HINOWA has rapidly expanded, and has dealers across the world - in countries as diverse as Australia, Hungary, the United Kingdom and Spain. However, its major focus is on the Europe region. HINOWA S.p.A. has become known across Europe for its range of dumper trucks in particular, which seek to combine stability and power. The company specializes in rubber of steel tracked varieties which are suitable for heavy duty earth moving, making them ideal for infrastructure projects or public horticultural uses. Their advanced designs are also known for their adaptability, and the firm has developed dumpers which can load into skips or other receptacles that are well above ground level. This has filled a gap in the market for high-tip tracked dumpers that are powerful and reliable.</p>\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d89972.69798863164!2d11.038422244100358!3d45.19424531766849!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x477f7ac349e9a837%3A0xe2fa2107b3402c93!2sHinowa+SpA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1432219278345\" width=\"800\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h2>HINOWA Product Portfolio</h2>\r\n<p>HINOWA S.p.A. manufactures a wide range of construction machinery, which includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tracked <a href=\"//trademachines.com/lifting-platforms\"><strong>aerial platforms</strong></a></li>\r\n<li>Tracked <a href=\"//trademachines.com/dumper-trucks\"><strong>minidumpers</strong></a></li>\r\n<li>Tracked <a href=\"//trademachines.com/forklifts\"><strong>forklifts</strong></a></li>\r\n<li>Tracked <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/tractors\">mini tractors</a></strong></li>\r\n<li>Tracked undercarriages</li>\r\n<li>Transporters</li>\r\n<li>Tracked high-tip dumpers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The HINOWA range is particularly suited to customers in the field of construction, and the firm deals with both private and public bodies.

Originally ALUP made equipment to pump air into car tyres and this original business is still reflected in its name today. ALUP stands for Auto-LUft-Pumpen, which literally translates as \"car air pumps\". From these modest beginnings, ALUP branched out into making both stationary and mobile piston compressors for industrial use. Over the years ALUP Kompressor has concentrated on its specialised market and introduced innovations as technology has advanced. In 1980, ALUP introduced <strong>screw compressor technology</strong> in a range of machinery from 2,2kW to 400 kW. ALUP Compressoren says that quality and service are at the heart of what it does. ALUP has an extensive research and development facility to ensure that it retains its position as a world leader in the compressed air industry.

Along with so many other innovations in vehicle mass production, the <strong>FORD Motor Company</strong> is credited with <strong>pioneering production</strong> of the very first <strong>petrol-driven tractor,</strong> which FORD called \"the automobile plough\". From 1917, the Fordson brand name was used on tractors and that brand continued to be used until 1964. The Fordson Model F is regarded as the first affordable tractor ever produced, available for $750. In 1928, the FORD Motor Company transferred tractor production from its headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan to Cork, Ireland and later to Dagenham in the British county of Essex. For a while, Ford tractors were produced in what was then Leningrad in the former Soviet Union. When, in 1964, the Fordson brand was abandoned, the tractors were branded simply as Fords, in both the United Kingdom and in the United States. In 1986, the FORD Motor Company bought out the <strong>agricultural manufacturer</strong> Sperry-New Holland to form Ford-New Holland, which in turn later bought out Versatile tractors.

During the 1990s, MAWERA was a leading installer of heating systems for renewable energy generation using techniques such as biomass, making sales across Europe, from the Czech Republic to the United Kingdom.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">Innovating to improve energy efficiency and make production as clean as possible</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The firm continually sought to introduce more efficient combustion systems, including trigeneration systems for the processing of waste wood. As companies and governments around Europe began to install more sustainable <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/energy-generation\">energy generation systems</a></strong>, they often turned to the technicians at MAWERA who by the 2000s had become experts in manufacturing combined heat and power and wood combustion heating and electricity generation systems. At the same time, the company has devised new ways of reducing harmful emissions such as Nitrogen Oxide from its burning systems, and has constantly worked to make their combustion chambers more energy efficient, part of the firm's deep commitment to sustainability. The company has been one of the first to offer energy generation from a wide range of biofuels, such as bark chippings, residual wood from manufacturing, wood pellets and sawdust. This has helped to build a loyal customer base of more than 5,000 organizations around the world who have installed MAWERA heating solutions.</p>\r\n<form></form>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify\">MAWERA Kessel &amp; Maschinen GmbH Product Portfolio</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The range of heating products manufactured by MAWERA includes:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify\">\r\n<li>Combined heat and power combustion systems</li>\r\n<li>Containerised domestic heating systems</li>\r\n<li>Double grate underfeed heating systems</li>\r\n<li>Flat moving grate systems</li>\r\n<li>Low nitrogen oxide adapted heating systems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The heating technology developed by MAWERA is used by both private and public sector clients in industry and domestic contexts.

The company's principle factory in Italy has now been converted into an impressive museum displaying an historically important collection of motorcycles from around the world.</p>\r\n<h2>The MORBIDELLI Vision and Worldwide Success </h2>\r\n<p>From humble beginnings the founder of the MORBIDELLI brand, Giancarlo Morbidelli, strived to develop his small <strong><a href=\"//trademachines.com/wood\">woodworking machinery</a></strong> factory located in Pesaro, on the east coast of Italy. With Giancarlo's hard work and entrepreneurship MORBIDELLI SCM grew into a successful business. At its height the company employed more than 300 staff. However Giancarlo's true passion was the world of motorcycle racing, with the success of his business he put his resources into building high-spec racing motorcycles. By the end of the 1960s his team were ready to compete in the Grand Prix 50cc races at the Italian championships. MORBIDELLI applied his technical and industrial knowledge to the construction of their motorbikes to great effect. Wins on the 1970s international racing circuit established the MORBIDELLI brand worldwide as an innovative and highly desirable motorcycle producer. In 1976 Giancarlo collaborated with Benelli Armi to set up a new factory to manufacture racing bikes for the wider market: they had previously only been available to the MORBIDELLI racing team drivers. The MORBIDELLI racing team continued to win many races including 4 world championships.</p>\r\n<p>Early in the 1990s Giancarlo decided to sell his thriving woodworking business and concentrate solely on developing a specialised 850cc sport touring motorcycle with an eight-cylinder engine. The resulting V8 had a retail price tag of US$60, 000, entering the 2001 Guinness Book of Records as the world's most expensive motorbike. It was a triumph of cutting-edge design and extraordinary engineering, and is now a collectors bike as so few were made.</p>\r\n<p>In 1999, the MORBIDELLI factory was fitted out to house Giancarlo's collection of 350 motorcycles from rare antique 1906 Moto Reves to a Ducati 851 Superbike and the famous V8.
